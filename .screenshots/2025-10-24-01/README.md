## How to Capture Screenshots

### Option 1: Run in Environment with Internet Access
The screenshot script is ready to use. In an environment with internet access:

```bash
# From project root
cd /home/user/white-cross

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install chromium

# Run the screenshot script
npx tsx .screenshots/capture-all-pages.ts
```

### Option 2: Use Docker with Pre-installed Browsers
```bash
# Use official Playwright Docker image
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  -w /app \
  --network host \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:latest \
  /bin/bash -c "npm install && npx tsx .screenshots/capture-all-pages.ts"
```

### Option 3: Run from CI/CD Pipeline
The script is designed to work in CI/CD environments where browsers are pre-installed:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install

- name: Install Playwright browsers
  run: npx playwright install chromium

- name: Capture screenshots
  run: npx tsx .screenshots/capture-all-pages.ts

- name: Upload screenshots
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: screenshots
    path: .screenshots/2025-10-24-01/*.png
```

### Option 4: Manual Screenshot Capture
If automated capture continues to fail:

1. Open browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Log in with credentials:
   - Email: `admin@whitecross.com`
   - Password: `Admin123!`
3. Visit each route listed above
4. Capture full-page screenshots (F12 → Ctrl+Shift+P → "Capture full size screenshot")
5. Save with the naming convention: `{name}.png` (e.g., `dashboard.png`)

## Script Details

### Authentication
The script logs in automatically with admin credentials:
- **Email:** admin@whitecross.com
- **Password:** Admin123!

### Screenshot Configuration
- **Viewport:** 1920x1080
- **Type:** Full-page screenshots
- **Format:** PNG
- **Wait time:** 2 seconds per page to ensure content loads
- **Timeout:** 15 seconds per navigation

### Error Handling
- Captures screenshots even if JavaScript errors occur on the page
- Continues to next route if one fails
- Logs all errors to console
- Records failures in manifest

## Files

- `capture-all-pages.ts` - Main screenshot script (ready to run)
- `routes-manifest.json` - Complete route inventory
- `README.md` - This file

## Additional Routes Defined (Not Yet Implemented)

The following routes are defined in `/home/user/white-cross/frontend/src/constants/routes.ts` but not implemented in the routing configuration:

- `/students` - Student management
- `/medications` - Medication management
- `/incident-reports` - Incident reporting
- `/emergency-contacts` - Emergency contacts
- `/communication` - Communication module
- `/documents` - Document management
- `/compliance` - Compliance module
- `/settings` - Settings/configuration
- `/profile` - User profile

These routes may be:
1. Planned for future implementation
2. Legacy route definitions
3. In development but not yet wired up

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Network Restrictions:** Contact IT/DevOps to allow browser downloads
2. **Run Script:** Execute `capture-all-pages.ts` once browsers are available
3. **Review Screenshots:** Verify all pages captured correctly
4. **Update Documentation:** Use screenshots for user documentation, training materials, etc.

## Technical Notes

- Frontend confirmed running at `http://localhost:5173` (verified with curl)
- Playwright 1.56.1 installed in project
- Node.js v22.20.0 available
- All route components exist and are properly imported
- Layout and authentication guards properly configured
