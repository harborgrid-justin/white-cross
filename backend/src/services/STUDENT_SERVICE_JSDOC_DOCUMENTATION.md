```typescript
/**
 * @class StudentQueryBuilder
 * @description Static utility for building Sequelize queries
 *
 * All methods are static and return query configuration objects that can be
 * passed directly to Sequelize methods (findAll, findAndCountAll, etc.)
 *
 * Design Pattern:
 * - Builder pattern for query construction
 * - Returns plain objects (Sequelize query options)
 * - Composable query parts
 *
 * @example
 * const whereClause = StudentQueryBuilder.buildWhereClause(filters);
 * const includeArray = StudentQueryBuilder.buildIncludeArray(filters);
 * const students = await Student.findAll({ where: whereClause, include: includeArray });

### Method Documentation

```typescript
/**
 * @method buildWhereClause
 * @description Build Sequelize where clause from filters
 * @static
 *
 * @param {StudentFilters} filters - Filter criteria

 * Supported Filters:
 * - search: Case-insensitive OR search on firstName, lastName, studentNumber
 * - grade: Exact match on grade
 * - isActive: Boolean filter for active status
 * - nurseId: Filter by assigned nurse UUID
 * - gender: Exact match on gender enum
 *
 * @example
 * const where = StudentQueryBuilder.buildWhereClause({

 * Always Includes:
 * - Emergency contacts (active only, ordered by priority)
 * - Assigned nurse (basic attributes only)
 * - Allergies (conditional required based on filter)
 * - Medications (conditional required based on filter)

 * Filter Behavior:
 * - hasAllergies: true โ required: true (inner join)
 * - hasAllergies: false/undefined โ required: false (left join)

 * Performance:
 * - Uses separate queries for large one-to-many (medications, health records)
 * - Limits included records to prevent huge result sets
 * - Ordered by relevance (most recent, highest severity)

## 6. student/index.ts

### File-Level Documentation

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Student Service Module Index - Facade and Exports
 * @module services/student
 * @description Main entry point for student service modules. Currently acts as a facade
 * to the monolithic studentService during migration. Will be fully modularized in future.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Temporary facade pattern during migration
 * - Delegates to monolithic studentService.ts
 * - Re-exports types from types.ts
 * - Will be split into modules: crud, search, statistics, transfer, bulk, export
 *
 * Future Modules (Planned):
 * - crudOperations.ts: Create, read, update, delete
 * - queryOperations.ts: Search, filtering, pagination
 * - statisticsOperations.ts: Analytics and reporting
 * - transferOperations.ts: Grade progression and nurse transfers
 * - bulkOperations.ts: Batch updates
 * - exportOperations.ts: Data export for compliance
 *
 * LOC: C41E6D37EC-I
 *
 * UPSTREAM (imports from):
 *   - studentService.ts (../studentService.ts)
 *   - types.ts (./types.ts)
 *
 * DOWNSTREAM (imported by):
 *   - students.ts (routes/students.ts)

## Summary

### Authorization Patterns Documented

1. **Nurse-Based Access Control**
   - Students assigned to specific nurses via `nurseId`
   - `getAssignedStudents()` filters by nurse
   - Transfer operations validate nurse existence
   - All operations logged for FERPA compliance

2. **Role-Based Access (Implied)**
   - Services expect caller to enforce role-based access
   - Authentication/authorization in route layer
   - Services focus on data validation and business logic

### CRUD Operations Documented

1. **Create**: `createStudent()` with validation and normalization
2. **Read**:
   - `getStudents()` - Paginated list with filters
   - `getStudentById()` - Complete profile
   - `searchStudents()` - Text search
   - `getStudentsByGrade()` - Grade-based retrieval
3. **Update**: `updateStudent()` with validation
4. **Delete**:
   - `deactivateStudent()` - Soft delete (preferred)
   - `deleteStudent()` - Permanent delete with cascade (dangerous)
5. **Transfer**: `transferStudent()` - Nurse reassignment

### Search/Filter Features Documented

1. **Pagination**: Page/limit parameters with metadata
2. **Text Search**: Case-insensitive across name and student number
3. **Grade Filter**: Exact match on grade level
4. **Active Status Filter**: Boolean for active/inactive
5. **Nurse Assignment Filter**: Filter by assigned nurse
6. **Health Filters**:
   - `hasAllergies` - Students with allergies
   - `hasMedications` - Students with medications
7. **Gender Filter**: Enum-based filtering

### Compliance Notes

1. **FERPA Compliance**:
   - All student data is protected education records
   - Access logging for audit trail
   - Disclosure requirements documented
   - Export functionality for legitimate requests

2. **HIPAA Compliance**:
   - PHI handling for health-related fields
   - Medical record number protection
   - Audit logging for access

3. **BIPA Compliance** (Photo Service):
   - Facial biometrics are sensitive identifiers
   - Consent requirements noted
   - Right to deletion supported

4. **Cascade Delete Warnings**:
   - Permanent deletion documented as dangerous
   - All related records cascade deleted
   - Transaction safety ensured
   - Prefer soft delete for normal operations

### Key Validation Rules

1. Student number: Unique, uppercase, trimmed
2. Medical record number: Unique if provided
3. Date of birth: 3-100 years in past
4. Nurse assignment: Must reference valid user
5. UUID format: Valid v4 UUIDs required
