/**
 * @fileoverview Permission Utilities for Hapi Framework
 * @module shared/security/permission.utils
 * @description Hapi-specific permission checking and authorization utilities.
 * Provides resource:action based permission model with role-based access control.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Resource-based permission model (resource:action pattern)
 * - Role-to-permission mapping with comprehensive healthcare roles
 * - Hapi middleware factories for route protection
 * - Student data access control with relationship validation
 * - HIPAA-compliant PHI access tracking
 *
 * Permission Model:
 * - Format: { resource: string, action: 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete' | 'manage' }
 * - Wildcard: '*' resource with 'manage' action grants all permissions
 * - Manage: 'manage' action includes all CRUD actions for that resource
 *
 * Scope Enforcement:
 * - School-level: Nurses and school admins limited to assigned schools
 * - District-level: District admins can access all schools in district
 * - System-level: Admins have unrestricted access
 *
 * @security Critical authorization utilities for route protection
 * @compliance HIPAA - Implements least-privilege access to PHI
 * @compliance FERPA - Student data access controls with relationship validation
 *

/**
 * Permission interface representing resource-action based access control
 *
 * @interface Permission
 *
 * @description Defines a single permission as a resource:action pair.
 * This model allows fine-grained control over what actions users can perform on specific resources.
 *
 * @property {string} resource - The resource type being accessed (e.g., 'students', 'medications', 'health-records')
 *   Can be '*' for wildcard (all resources)
 *
 * @property {'create'|'read'|'update'|'delete'|'manage'} action - The action being performed
 *   - create: Create new instances of the resource
 *   - read: View existing instances
 *   - update: Modify existing instances
 *   - delete: Remove instances
 *   - manage: All CRUD actions (includes create, read, update, delete)
 *
 * @example
 * // Allow reading student health records
 * const permission: Permission = {
 *   resource: 'health-records',
 *   action: 'read'
 * };
 *
 * @example
 * // Allow full medication management
 * const permission: Permission = {
 *   resource: 'medications',
 *   action: 'manage'
 * };
 *
 * @example
 * // Admin wildcard permission
 * const adminPermission: Permission = {
 *   resource: '*',
 *   action: 'manage'

 *
 * @constant {Record<UserRole, Permission[]>}
 * @private

 * @description Maps each user role to their granted permissions using resource:action pairs.
 * Defines the complete access control matrix for the healthcare platform.
 *
 * Role Capabilities Summary:
 * - ADMIN: Full system access (wildcard permission)
 * - NURSE: Complete health record and medication management at school level
 * - SCHOOL_ADMIN: School operations, reports, limited PHI access
 * - DISTRICT_ADMIN: Multi-school management with full access
 * - VIEWER: Read-only access to non-sensitive information
 * - COUNSELOR: Mental health records and appointment management
 *
 * Permission Strategy:
 * - Explicit permissions per role (no automatic inheritance)
 * - 'manage' action implies all CRUD permissions for that resource
 * - Wildcard '*' resource grants access to all resources
 * - PHI access limited to clinical roles (NURSE, ADMIN)
 *
 * @security This matrix controls all route-level authorization
 * @compliance HIPAA - Minimum necessary access principle enforced

 * @example
 * // Get all permissions for a nurse
 * const nursePerms = ROLE_PERMISSIONS[UserRole.NURSE];
 * // Returns array of Permission objects

 * Implements two-level permission checking:

 * 2. Specific check: Check for exact resource match with action or 'manage' permission

 * - Wildcard: user has '*' resource with 'manage' action (admin-level access)

 *
 * @description Factory function that creates Hapi pre-handler middleware for permission-based
 * route protection. Validates that authenticated user has required permission before allowing
 * request to proceed to route handler.
 *
 * Middleware Flow:
 * 1. Extract user credentials from request.auth.credentials
 * 2. Verify user is authenticated
 * 3. Check if user.role has required permission via hasPermission()
 * 4. Return h.continue if authorized, throw Boom error if not
 *
 * Integration with Hapi:
 * - Use in route.options.pre array for pre-handler validation
 * - Runs before route handler executes
 * - Automatically handled by Hapi's lifecycle system
 * - Boom errors converted to appropriate HTTP responses
 *
 * @security Critical security middleware - validates all permission-based access
 * @compliance HIPAA - All PHI access routes must use this middleware
 *
 * @example
 * // Protect health records route
 * {

 *       return getHealthRecord(request.params.id);

 *
 * @description Creates Hapi pre-handler middleware that validates user has permission to access
 * a specific student's data. Extracts studentId from route params or request payload, then checks
 * access permissions via canAccessStudent().
 *
 * Middleware Flow:
 * 1. Extract user from request.auth.credentials
 * 2. Extract studentId from request.params or request.payload
 * 3. Verify user is authenticated
 * 4. Verify studentId is present
 * 5. Check access permission via canAccessStudent()

 * - First checks request.params.studentId (from URL path parameters)
 * - Falls back to request.payload.studentId (from POST/PUT body)
 * - Throws badRequest error if neither is present
 *
 * Use Cases:
 * - Protect student detail routes (GET /students/{studentId})
 * - Validate access before updating student data
 * - Enforce relationship-based access (parent viewing own child)
