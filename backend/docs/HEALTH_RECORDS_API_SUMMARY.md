### Input Validation
- **Comprehensive Joi Schemas:** Every endpoint has detailed validation
- **Type Safety:** Enums for categorical values
- **Date Validation:** ISO 8601 format required
- **Range Validation:** Numeric ranges validated (e.g., BMI percentile 0-100)
- **Required Fields:** Clear distinction between required and optional fields

### Error Handling
- **404 Not Found:** Proper handling for missing records
- **400 Bad Request:** Invalid input data
- **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication failures
- **403 Forbidden:** Insufficient permissions
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Server-side errors
- **501 Not Implemented:** PDF generation placeholders

---

## OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation

Every route includes:
- **Tags:** Organized by module (Health Records, Allergies, etc.)
- **Description:** Clear, concise endpoint description
- **Notes:** Detailed PHI protection level and usage notes
- **Response Codes:** All possible HTTP responses documented
- **Security:** JWT authentication requirements
- **Parameters:** Full parameter descriptions with types and constraints

## Next Steps

### 1. Service Layer Implementation
Create or update `backend/src/services/healthRecordService.ts` with all required methods.

### 2. Database Schema
Ensure Prisma schema includes all necessary models:
- HealthRecord
- Allergy
- ChronicCondition
- Vaccination
- Screening
- GrowthMeasurement
- VitalSigns

### 3. Middleware Integration
Add RBAC and student access validation:
```typescript
import { requirePermission } from '../middleware/rbac';
import { requireStudentAccess } from '../middleware/studentAccess';
```

### 4. Audit Logging
Implement PHI access and modification logging in service layer.

### 5. Rate Limiting
Add rate limiting to export and search endpoints.

### 6. Testing
Create comprehensive test suites for all endpoints.

## Usage Examples

### Create Allergy
```bash
POST /api/health-records/allergies
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "studentId": "student-123",
  "allergen": "Penicillin",
  "allergyType": "MEDICATION",
  "severity": "LIFE_THREATENING",
  "reaction": "Anaphylaxis",
  "verified": false,
  "notes": "Parent reported, needs medical verification"
}
```

### Check Medication Contraindications
```bash
POST /api/health-records/allergies/check-contraindications
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "studentId": "student-123",
  "medicationId": "med-456"
}
```

### Get Vaccination Compliance
```bash
GET /api/health-records/vaccinations/student/student-123/compliance
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### Export Health Records
```bash
GET /api/health-records/student/student-123/export?format=json
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

## Security Notes

1. **PHI Protection:** All endpoints handle Protected Health Information and require strict access controls.

2. **Audit Requirements:** Every access and modification should be logged with:
   - User ID and role
   - Action performed
   - Student ID accessed
   - Timestamp
   - IP address
   - Success/failure status

3. **Data Encryption:** All PHI should be encrypted at rest and in transit (HTTPS required).

4. **Access Logging:** Implement PHI access logging middleware to track all data access.

5. **Role Hierarchy:**
   - ADMIN: Full access to all endpoints
   - NURSE: Full access to clinical data
   - TEACHER: Read-only access to basic health info
   - PARENT: Read-only access to own children only

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Pagination:** Implemented on list endpoints to handle large datasets
2. **Indexing:** Database indexes needed on:
   - studentId (all tables)
   - Date fields for filtering
   - Status fields for queries
3. **Caching:** Consider caching frequently accessed data like allergies and chronic conditions
4. **Query Optimization:** Use select clauses to fetch only needed fields

---

## Compliance & Standards

This implementation adheres to:
- **HIPAA:** Protected Health Information security requirements
- **FERPA:** Student education record privacy
- **REST API Best Practices:** Proper HTTP methods, status codes, and resource naming
- **OpenAPI 3.0:** Complete API documentation
- **Joi Validation:** Strong input validation
- **Healthcare Interoperability:** Structured data for potential HL7/FHIR integration
