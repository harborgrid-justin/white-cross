   - 5 controller methods for student management
   - Date conversion handling for dateOfBirth
   - Filter building for search and filtering

2. **Students Validators** (`operations/validators/students.validators.ts`) - 210 lines

   - 5 HTTP endpoints with `/api/v1/students/` prefix
   - Comprehensive Swagger documentation with PHI protection notes

4. **Students Tests** (`__tests__/students.controller.test.ts`) - 155 lines
   - 7 test cases covering all 5 methods
   - Tests pagination, filtering, date conversion, deactivation

5. **Operations Module Index** (`operations/index.ts`) - 18 lines
   - Aggregates operations routes
   - Documents future additions

6. **Updated v1 Index** - Added operations module

## ðŸ“Š **Routes Migrated (5 endpoints)**

1. `GET /api/v1/students` - List with pagination and filters
2. `GET /api/v1/students/{id}` - Get student by ID
3. `POST /api/v1/students` - Create new student
4. `PUT /api/v1/students/{id}` - Update student
5. `POST /api/v1/students/{id}/deactivate` - Deactivate student

**Remaining:** 6 more student routes (transfer, search, by grade, assigned students, health records access)
