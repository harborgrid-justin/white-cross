### Critical Build Issues

#### 3.1 TypeScript Compilation Errors

**Backend**:
```
error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'jest'.
error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'node'.
```

**Impact**: Missing type definitions
**Resolution**:
```bash
cd backend
npm install --save-dev @types/jest @types/node
```

**Frontend**:
```
src/lib/performance/lazy.ts(324,26): error TS1005: ',' expected.
src/pages/medications/components/MedicationSearchBar.tsx(23,56): error TS1128
src/pages/students/components/StudentPagination.tsx(81,39): error TS1128
```

**Impact**: Prevents production build, syntax errors in 3 files
**Resolution**: Fix syntax errors in the following files:
1. `/frontend/src/lib/performance/lazy.ts` (line 324)
2. `/frontend/src/pages/medications/components/MedicationSearchBar.tsx` (lines 23-114)
3. `/frontend/src/pages/students/components/StudentPagination.tsx` (lines 81-173)

#### 3.2 Missing Test Dependencies

**Backend**:
```
jest: not found
```

**Frontend**:
```
vitest: not found
```

**Impact**: Cannot run test suite, dependencies not installed
**Resolution**:
```bash
# Backend
cd /home/user/white-cross/backend
npm install
