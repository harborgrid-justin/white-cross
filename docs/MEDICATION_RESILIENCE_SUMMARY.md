**Project:** White Cross Healthcare Platform
**Module:** Medication Management
**Classification:** CRITICAL SAFETY SYSTEM
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-10

---

## Overview

This document provides an executive summary of the comprehensive resilience architecture designed for the medication management module. The architecture ensures **zero data loss** for medication administration records and maintains **absolute safety** in all medication operations.

---

## Critical Safety Requirements

### Primary Objectives

1. **NEVER lose medication administration records** - Legal and safety evidence
2. **PREVENT duplicate administrations** - Life-threatening risk
3. **FAIL-SAFE controlled substance tracking** - Regulatory compliance
4. **MAINTAIN Five Rights validation** - Patient safety standard
5. **ENSURE adverse reaction reporting** - Safety event capture

### Compliance

- ✅ HIPAA compliant
- ✅ FDA 21 CFR Part 11
- ✅ Healthcare safety standards
- ✅ Audit trail requirements

---

## Architecture Components

### 1. Three-Level Resilience System

#### **Level 1: CRITICAL** (Zero-Loss Operations)
- Medication administration logging
- Adverse reaction reporting
- Controlled substance tracking
- **SLA:** 99.999% durability, zero data loss acceptable
- **Features:** Offline queue, infinite retry, dead letter queue, immediate alerting

#### **Level 2: HIGH** (Business Critical)
- Prescription management
- Medication allergy checks
- Drug interaction validation
- **SLA:** 99.9% availability, 3-second response time
- **Features:** Circuit breaker, 3 retries, cached fallback, escalated alerts

#### **Level 3: STANDARD** (Non-Critical)
- Inventory queries
- Medication search
- Report generation
- **SLA:** 99% availability, 10-second response time
- **Features:** Standard circuit breaker, limited retry, stale data acceptable

---

## Key Technologies & Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```
CLOSED → monitors requests
  ↓ (failure threshold exceeded)
OPEN → fail fast, execute fallback
  ↓ (after timeout period)
HALF-OPEN → test with limited requests
  ↓ (success threshold met)
CLOSED → normal operation restored
```

**Configuration by Level:**
- **Level 1:** Opens after 1 failure, 30s timeout, 5 successes to close
- **Level 2:** Opens after 3 failures or 50% error rate, 1min timeout
- **Level 3:** Opens after 5 failures or 60% error rate, 2min timeout

### Retry Mechanism

**Level 1 (Infinite Retry):**
```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: 1s + jitter
Attempt 4: 4s + jitter
Attempt 10: ~4 minutes
Attempt 20+: 1 hour (max)
Continues up to 7 days → Dead Letter Queue
```

**Level 2 (3 Attempts):** 500ms → 1s → 2s (with jitter)

**Level 3 (2 Attempts):** 1s → 1.5s (with jitter)

### Offline Queue Architecture

```
Frontend Administration
         ↓
   Generate Idempotency Key
         ↓
   Try Direct Submission
    ↙           ↘
Success      Network/DB Failure
   ↓                ↓
Return          Queue Locally
Result          (IndexedDB)
                     ↓
              Background Sync
                (every 30s)
                     ↓
              Server Receives
                     ↓
              Idempotency Check
                     ↓
              Process or Skip
```

**Storage:** IndexedDB (web), SQLite (mobile)
**Sync Triggers:** Network restored, periodic (30s), user action, app foreground
**Batch Processing:** 10 records, 3 concurrent

---

## Safety Mechanisms

### Five Rights Validation

1. **Right Patient** - Verified by prescription lookup
2. **Right Medication** - Cross-referenced with prescription
3. **Right Dose** - Exact match required (500mg ≠ 1000mg)
4. **Right Route** - Validated against prescription route
5. **Right Time** - Within 1-hour variance window

**Enforcement:** Pre-execution validation, system-level blocking

### Duplicate Prevention

**Detection Windows:**
- Administration: 1 hour before/after scheduled time
- Idempotency: 24-hour key validity

**Mechanisms:**
- Database uniqueness constraint on idempotency key
- Time-window duplicate check
- Redis cache for fast lookup

### Allergy Conflict Detection

**Severity Levels Blocked:**
- SEVERE
- LIFE_THREATENING

**Matching Algorithm:**
- Medication name contains allergen
- Generic name contains allergen
- Allergen contains medication name

**Action:** Hard block with safety event logging

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Critical Metrics

| Metric | Type | Alert Threshold |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Administration success rate | Gauge | < 99% |
| Queue backlog age | Gauge | > 5 minutes |
| Circuit breaker state | State | OPEN |
| DLQ items | Counter | > 0 |
| Five Rights violations | Counter | > 0 |
| Severe adverse reactions | Counter | > 0 |
| Duplicate attempts prevented | Counter | Any occurrence |

### Alert Channels

- **CRITICAL:** PagerDuty + SMS + Slack
- **HIGH:** Slack + Email
- **STANDARD:** Email

### Escalation Policy

```
CRITICAL Alert Fired
    ↓
Immediate: On-call nurse, Tech lead
    ↓ (after 1 minute)
Escalate: Chief Nursing Officer, CTO
    ↓ (after 5 minutes)
Incident: Full incident response team
```

## Error Handling Standards

### Error Classification

**Safety Critical (Level 1):**
- `DUPLICATE_ADMINISTRATION`
- `WRONG_PATIENT`
- `WRONG_MEDICATION`
- `WRONG_DOSE`
- `ALLERGY_CONFLICT`
- `FIVE_RIGHTS_VIOLATION`

**Operational Critical (Level 2):**
- `PRESCRIPTION_EXPIRED`
- `CONTROLLED_SUBSTANCE_NO_WITNESS`
- `INVENTORY_INSUFFICIENT`

**Infrastructure (Level 3):**
- `DATABASE_ERROR`
- `NETWORK_ERROR`
- `TIMEOUT_ERROR`

### Error Response Flow

```
Error Occurs
    ↓
Classify Error Type
    ↓
Level 1? → Log Safety Event → Create Incident Report → Alert Critical
    ↓
Level 2? → Log Warning → Retry with Circuit Breaker → Alert High
    ↓
Level 3? → Log Info → Standard Retry → No Alert
```
