# Security Migration Guide

**Platform:** White Cross Healthcare Management System
**Target Audience:** Development Team
**Migration Type:** Token Storage & Security Enhancement
**Impact Level:** Medium (Automatic migration, but users will need to re-login)

---

## üìã Overview

This guide helps you understand the changes made to the authentication and security system, and what actions (if any) are required.

---

## üîÑ What Changed?

### Token Storage Migration: localStorage ‚Üí sessionStorage

**Before:**
```typescript
// Tokens stored in localStorage (persists across browser restarts)
localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
localStorage.getItem('refresh_token')
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Tokens stored in sessionStorage (cleared on browser close)
secureTokenManager.getToken()
secureTokenManager.getRefreshToken()
```

### Why This Change?

1. **Security:** sessionStorage is cleared when browser closes, preventing token persistence
2. **HIPAA Compliance:** Better protection for PHI access credentials
3. **Best Practice:** Healthcare applications should not persist sessions indefinitely

---

## üöÄ Automatic Migration

The SecureTokenManager **automatically migrates** existing tokens from localStorage to sessionStorage on first load:

1. Checks for tokens in localStorage
2. Validates they haven't expired
3. Moves valid tokens to sessionStorage
4. Removes tokens from localStorage
5. Continues working seamlessly

**No code changes required** for existing authentication flows!

---

## üë• User Impact

### What Users Will Experience:

1. **First Visit After Deployment:**
   - Existing valid sessions will continue working
   - Tokens automatically migrated to sessionStorage

2. **After Closing Browser/Tab:**
   - Users will need to login again (expected behavior)
   - This is a SECURITY FEATURE, not a bug

3. **During Active Session:**
   - 8-hour inactivity timeout (from SECURITY_CONFIG)
   - Automatic logout after inactivity
   - Token expiration based on JWT exp claim

### Communication Template:

```
Subject: Enhanced Security Measures - Session Changes

Dear White Cross Users,

We've implemented enhanced security measures to better protect patient health information:

1. Sessions now expire when you close your browser (improved security)
2. Automatic logout after 8 hours of inactivity
3. Stronger password requirements for new accounts (12+ characters)

You may need to log in again after this update. This is expected and improves the security of patient data.

Thank you for helping us maintain HIPAA compliance.
```

## üíª Developer Migration

### Code That Needs No Changes ‚úÖ

Most existing code will work without changes because `tokenUtils` was updated to use SecureTokenManager:

```typescript
// These still work (backward compatible)
tokenUtils.getToken()
tokenUtils.setToken(token)
tokenUtils.clearAll()

// API calls still work
apiInstance.get('/students')
apiClient.post('/students', data)
```

### Code That Should Be Updated üîÑ

If you have any **direct localStorage access** for tokens, update it:

#### Before:
```typescript
// ‚ùå Old way - direct localStorage access
const token = localStorage.getItem('auth_token');
localStorage.setItem('auth_token', token);
localStorage.removeItem('auth_token');
```

#### After:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ New way - use SecureTokenManager
import { secureTokenManager } from '@/services/security';

const token = secureTokenManager.getToken();
secureTokenManager.setToken(token, refreshToken, expiresIn);
secureTokenManager.clearTokens();
```

### Finding Direct localStorage Usage

Search for these patterns in your code:

```bash
# In the frontend directory
cd frontend/src

# Find direct localStorage usage for auth
grep -r "localStorage.getItem('auth" .
grep -r "localStorage.setItem('auth" .
grep -r "localStorage.removeItem('auth" .
grep -r "localStorage.getItem('refresh" .
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Testing

- [ ] Test login flow
- [ ] Test logout flow
- [ ] Test token refresh
- [ ] Test session expiration (wait 8+ hours or manually expire)
- [ ] Test closing browser and reopening (should require re-login)
- [ ] Test API calls with valid token
- [ ] Test API calls with expired token (should redirect to login)
- [ ] Test password validation (12+ chars with complexity)
- [ ] Test CSRF token injection in POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests
- [ ] Test HTTPS enforcement in production build

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

- [ ] Monitor login rates (expect increase after browser closes)
- [ ] Check for token-related errors
- [ ] Verify CSRF tokens are present in requests
- [ ] Confirm HTTPS is being used
- [ ] Review security logs for issues

---

## üîß Backend Requirements

### Required Backend Changes

#### 1. CSRF Token Support

**Add to HTML Template:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- CSRF token meta tag -->
    <meta name="csrf-token" content="<%= csrfToken %>">
    <!-- OR set in cookie -->
</head>
</html>
```

**CSRF Middleware Example (Express):**
```javascript
const csurf = require('csurf');

// Setup CSRF protection
const csrfProtection = csurf({
  cookie: {
    httpOnly: true,
    sameSite: 'strict',
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  }
});

app.use(csrfProtection);

// Send CSRF token to client
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
  // OR set in template
  res.render('index', { csrfToken: req.csrfToken() });
});
```

#### 2. Token Refresh Endpoint

**Update Response to Include expiresIn:**
```javascript
POST /api/auth/refresh

Response:
{
  "token": "new-jwt-token",
  "refreshToken": "new-refresh-token",  // Optional
  "expiresIn": 86400  // Seconds until expiration
}
```

#### 3. HTTPS Configuration

**Nginx Example:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name api.whitecross.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    if ($scheme != "https") {
        return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
    }

    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
    }
}
```

---

## üìä Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can temporarily disable the new security features:

### Emergency Rollback (Not Recommended)

1. **Revert to localStorage:**
```typescript
// In apiConfig.ts - temporarily revert token retrieval
const token = localStorage.getItem('auth_token');
```

2. **Disable CSRF (Temporarily):**
```typescript
// Comment out in apiConfig.ts
// setupCsrfProtection(apiInstance);
```

### Better Approach: Fix Issues

Instead of rolling back, fix specific issues:

- **Token expiration too aggressive?** Update `SECURITY_CONFIG.SESSION_TIMEOUT`
- **CSRF tokens not working?** Verify backend setup
- **HTTPS issues?** Check environment variables

---

## üìà Performance Impact

### Expected Changes:

- **Positive:**
  - Faster initial page load (no localStorage parsing)
  - Better memory management (sessionStorage cleanup)
  - Improved security posture

- **Neutral:**
  - Minimal overhead from token validation
  - CSRF token lookup is fast (meta tag or cookie)

- **User Experience:**
  - Need to re-login after browser close (by design)
  - 8-hour inactivity timeout (configurable)

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Token expired immediately after login"

**Cause:** Token expiresIn not provided or incorrect

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Ensure backend returns expiresIn in seconds
const response = {
  token: "...",
  refreshToken: "...",
  expiresIn: 86400  // 24 hours in seconds
};
```

### Issue 2: "CSRF token not found"

**Cause:** Backend not setting meta tag or cookie

**Solution:**
```html
<!-- Add to HTML template -->
<meta name="csrf-token" content="<%= csrfToken %>">
```

### Issue 3: "Users logged out too quickly"

**Cause:** SESSION_TIMEOUT too short

**Solution:**
```typescript
// In constants/config.ts
export const SECURITY_CONFIG = {
  SESSION_TIMEOUT: 12 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // Increase to 12 hours
};
```

### Issue 4: "HTTP not allowed in production error"

**Cause:** VITE_API_BASE_URL using http:// instead of https://

**Solution:**
```bash
# Update .env.production
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.whitecross.com/api
```

### Before Escalating:

1. Check this migration guide
2. Review `SECURITY_FIXES_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify environment variables
5. Test in development first

### Escalation Path:

1. **Development Team Lead**
