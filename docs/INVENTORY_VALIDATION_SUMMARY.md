3. **API Layer:** Zod schemas provide immediate feedback to frontend applications
4. **Consistency:** All validation rules are synchronized between frontend and backend

This multi-layered approach ensures:
- ✅ Data integrity
- ✅ Security against injection attacks
- ✅ Healthcare compliance (HIPAA, DEA)
- ✅ Budget constraint enforcement
- ✅ Proper workflow management
- ✅ Excellent user experience with clear error messages
