# Development Workflow and Best Practices

## Git Workflow Standards
- Use descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format
- Create feature branches for all new development work
- Keep commits atomic and focused on single changes
- Use pull requests for code review before merging to main
- Maintain a clean Git history with meaningful commit messages

## Branch Management
- Use `main` branch for production-ready code
- Create feature branches with descriptive names (feature/user-authentication)
- Use hotfix branches for critical production fixes
- Delete feature branches after successful merge
- Keep branches up to date with main branch

## Development Environment
- Use consistent development tools across the team
- Maintain environment configuration files (.env.example)
- Document setup instructions for new developers
- Use Docker or similar containerization for consistency
- Keep development dependencies separate from production

## Code Review Process
- All code must be reviewed before merging
- Review for functionality, security, and maintainability
- Provide constructive feedback and suggestions
- Test changes locally when possible
- Approve only when confident in the changes

## Release Management
- Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Maintain a changelog for all releases
- Tag releases in version control
- Test thoroughly before production deployment
- Have rollback procedures ready

## Issue and Task Management
- Create detailed issue descriptions with acceptance criteria
- Use labels and milestones for organization
- Link commits and pull requests to issues
- Keep issues up to date with progress
- Close issues only when fully resolved

## Continuous Integration/Deployment
- Run automated tests on all pull requests
- Use consistent build and deployment processes
- Deploy to staging environment before production
- Monitor deployments and have alerting in place
- Maintain deployment documentation and procedures
