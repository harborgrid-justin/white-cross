## Summary Statistics

### By Implementation Status
- **Fully Implemented** (✅): ~5%
- **Partially Implemented** (⚠️): ~40%
- **Missing** (❌): ~25%
- **Needs Investigation** (🔍): ~30%

### Critical Findings

1. **Health Records - MAJOR GAP**:
   - Main page is just a skeleton
   - Modals exist but not integrated
   - No API integration
   - Missing tab navigation

2. **Mock Data Everywhere**:
   - Students, Incidents, and likely others use mock data
   - API integration TODOs throughout
   - No real backend communication

3. **Delete Operations Missing**:
   - Almost no delete functionality visible
   - Confirmation dialogs exist but integration unclear

4. **Inconsistent Patterns**:
   - Some domains use modals, others use separate pages
   - Different state management approaches
   - Varying levels of completeness

5. **Good Dialog/Modal Coverage**:
   - Many domains have create/edit dialogs
   - Good separation of concerns
   - Validation and error handling patterns present

### Next Steps Required

1. **Detailed Investigation Needed** for:
   - All medication tabs
   - Inventory pages
   - Appointments functionality
   - All "Needs Investigation" items

2. **API Integration Verification**:
   - Check actual API service files
   - Verify which endpoints exist
   - Identify mock vs real data

3. **Missing Page Analysis**:
   - Verify if linked pages exist (create/edit)
   - Check routing configuration
   - Identify placeholder routes

4. **Pattern Documentation**:
   - Document working patterns
   - Identify anti-patterns
   - Create standardization recommendations
