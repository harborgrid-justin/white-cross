# React CRUD Pattern Analysis Plan - R3A7C9

## Objective
Conduct comprehensive review of React component patterns for CRUD operations across the frontend codebase to identify improvement opportunities and standardization needs.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery (In Progress)
- Identify all CRUD-related components (forms, tables, modals, dialogs)
- Catalog component locations and primary purposes
- Map component relationships and dependencies

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis
- Analyze component structure and reusability
- Review hooks usage (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
- Examine form handling patterns (controlled components, validation)
- Review data fetching patterns (queries, mutations, loading states)

### Phase 3: Type Safety Validation
- Check TypeScript prop types
- Validate interface definitions
- Review type safety across components

### Phase 4: Performance Review
- Identify unnecessary re-renders
- Check for missing memoization
- Review code duplication opportunities

### Phase 5: Reporting
- Compile findings
- Identify common patterns (good and bad)
- Recommend reusable components
- Document performance optimizations
- Provide best practices recommendations

## Deliverables
- Comprehensive analysis report with specific file examples
- Recommendations for standardization
- List of reusable components to create
- Performance optimization roadmap
