# React CRUD Pattern Analysis Progress - R3A7C9

## Current Phase: Analysis Complete
**Status**: Comprehensive analysis completed
**Started**: 2025-10-24
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-24

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Discovery ✅
- Located 52+ files with modal/dialog patterns (345 modal instances)
- Identified health records CRUD components (allergies, vaccinations, conditions)
- Analyzed settings CRUD tabs (Users, Schools, Districts)
- Examined custom hooks structure (93+ domain hooks)
- Reviewed data fetching patterns (TanStack Query, fetch API)

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis ✅
- Analyzed form handling patterns across components
- Reviewed modal implementation patterns
- Examined table/list patterns
- Analyzed hooks usage and structure
- Identified code duplication patterns

### Phase 3: Findings Compiled ✅
- Common good patterns documented
- Common bad patterns identified
- Performance issues cataloged
- Reusability opportunities identified
- Best practices recommendations prepared

## Key Findings Summary

### Components Analyzed
- Health Records Modals: AllergyModal, VaccinationModal, ConditionModal
- Settings Tabs: UsersTab, SchoolsTab, DistrictsTab
- Tab Component: AllergiesTab
- Custom Hooks: useHealthQueries, useStudentMutations

### Pattern Categories
1. **Modal Patterns**: 345 inline modal instances across 52 files
2. **Form Patterns**: Mixed controlled/uncontrolled, no validation library
3. **Table Patterns**: Duplicate pagination, sorting, filtering logic
4. **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query + raw fetch mixing
5. **Hooks Usage**: Good structure but inconsistent usage

### Critical Issues
- No shared Modal component
- Duplicate form handling logic
- Inconsistent validation patterns
- No form state management library
- Duplicate CRUD table patterns

## Next Steps
Generate comprehensive report with specific examples and recommendations
