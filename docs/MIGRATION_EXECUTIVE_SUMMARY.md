# Prisma to Sequelize Migration - Executive Summary

**White Cross Healthcare Platform - Production-Grade ORM Migration**

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Prepared By**: AI Agent Team (Database Architect + Node.js Engineer + Enterprise API Engineer)
**Classification**: Internal - Technical Migration Plan

---

## üéØ Mission Statement

Migrate the White Cross Healthcare Platform's backend from **Prisma ORM to Sequelize ORM** to achieve enterprise-grade scalability, performance, and maintainability for our HIPAA-compliant student health management system.

---

## üìä Executive Summary

### Why This Migration?

Prisma, while developer-friendly, lacks critical enterprise features needed for our healthcare platform:

| Limitation | Business Impact | Sequelize Solution |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Limited raw SQL support | Complex inventory queries fail | Full SQL access + ORM benefits |
| Immature pooling | Connection exhaustion under load | Enterprise connection pooling |
| Rigid query patterns | Cannot optimize slow queries | Fine-grained query control |
| Growing pains | Not fully enterprise-ready | Battle-tested for 12+ years |
| Limited hooks | Hard to implement HIPAA audit | Native hook system for compliance |

### Migration Scope

**Platform Overview**:
- **53 Database Models** managing student health records
- **30+ Service Files** with complex business logic
- **100+ API Endpoints** serving nurses, admins, and staff
- **HIPAA Compliance** with complete audit trail requirements
- **Multi-tenant** architecture (districts ‚Üí schools ‚Üí students)

**Technical Scope**:
```
üìÅ Backend Architecture
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 53 Sequelize Models (from 53 Prisma models)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 41 TypeScript Enums
