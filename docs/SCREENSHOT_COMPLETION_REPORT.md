## Technical Details

### Database Schema Fix Applied
```sql
-- 15 columns added to users table for authentication & security
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN "schoolId" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN "districtId" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone TEXT;
-- ... (12 more security-related columns)
```

### Recommended Architecture Improvements
1. Global error boundaries for all routes
2. Loading states with skeleton screens
3. User-friendly error messages instead of blank pages
4. Comprehensive database schema validation
5. Improved health check that verifies schema
6. Database migration system for schema changes

- `docs/screenshots/README.md` - Complete screenshot index
- `docs/BLANK_PAGE_FIXES.md` - Production-ready fix guide
- `docs/screenshots/*.png` - 24 screenshot files
- `docs/screenshots/*.placeholder.txt` - 26 blank page placeholders

**Code Changes:**
- Database: Added 15 columns to users table
- Backend: Schema validation confirmed
- Frontend: Issues identified and documented
