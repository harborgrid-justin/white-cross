- Verification utilities included
```

**2. Focus Management System**

class FocusManager {
  - trapFocus(container)
  - saveFocus() / restoreFocus()
  - focusFirstError(form)
}
```

**3. ARIA Announcer**
```typescript
class AriaAnnouncer {
  - announce(message) // Polite
  - announceUrgent(message) // Assertive
  - clear()
}
```

**4. Keyboard Navigation**
```typescript
- Tab order management
- Arrow key navigation
- Home/End keys
- Escape key handling
- Keyboard shortcuts (Alt+N, Alt+S, Alt+C)
```

### Reusable Component Library

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **WCAG AA Minimum, AAA for Critical**
   - Rationale: Industry standard for healthcare; patient safety requires enhanced accessibility
   - Impact: Clear baseline established for all features

2. **Reusable Accessibility Utilities**
   - Rationale: Consistency and reduced implementation complexity
   - Impact: AriaAnnouncer and FocusManager used across all features

3. **Explicit Label Associations**
   - Rationale: Implicit labels not reliable across screen readers
   - Impact: All forms use `<label for="id">` pattern

4. **Data Table Alternatives for Charts**
   - Rationale: Screen readers cannot interact with charts directly
   - Impact: All visualizations include accessible data tables

5. **PHIMasked Component**
   - Rationale: Balance HIPAA privacy with accessibility needs
   - Impact: Consistent masking with secure reveal and audit logging

6. **Multi-Modal Emergency Alerts**
   - Rationale: Critical alerts must be perceivable by all users
   - Impact: Visual, audible, and screen reader alerts for emergencies

7. **Keyboard Shortcuts for Workflows**
   - Rationale: Power users and keyboard-only users benefit from efficiency
   - Impact: Alt+N (nav), Alt+S (search), Alt+C (content) implemented

8. **Generic PHI Announcements**
   - Rationale: HIPAA compliance requires no PHI exposure
   - Impact: All screen reader messages use generic descriptions
