2. ✅ **No code changes required** - All files migrated
3. ✅ **Mark task as COMPLETE** - Agent 8 verification confirms completion

### Future (Optional)
1. **Archive Migration Backup**
   - Consider moving `.migration-backup/` to cold storage after 30-90 days
   - Document backup location for historical reference

2. **Team Communication**
   - Ensure all developers aware migration is complete
   - Update any remaining Prisma references in wikis/docs
   - Update onboarding documentation

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Baseline Sequelize query performance
   - Monitor slow queries and optimize as needed
   - Compare performance against Prisma baseline (if available)

4. **CI/CD Verification** (If not done)
   - Ensure deployment scripts use `sequelize-cli db:migrate`
   - Remove any remaining `npx prisma` commands
   - Test migration deployment in staging
