## Technical Implementation Notes

### hapi-swagger Configuration
All routes use hapi-swagger plugin configuration:

```typescript
options: {
  auth: 'jwt',
  tags: ['api', 'HealthRecords', 'Healthcare', 'v1'],
  description: 'Short endpoint description',
  notes: 'Detailed notes including PHI classification and usage',
  validate: {
    params: Joi.object({...}),
    query: Joi.object({...}),
    payload: Joi.object({...})
  },
  plugins: {
    'hapi-swagger': {
      responses: {
        '200': { description: 'Success response' },
        '400': { description: 'Validation error' },
        '401': { description: 'Unauthorized' },
        '403': { description: 'Forbidden' },
        '404': { description: 'Not found' },
        '500': { description: 'Server error' }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Joi Validation Schemas
All request validation uses Joi schemas with:
- Type validation (string, number, date, uuid, etc.)
- Length constraints (min, max for strings)
- Range constraints (min, max for numbers)
- Pattern matching (regex for codes)
- Enum validation (valid values)
- Required vs. optional fields
- Custom error messages

### Example Joi Schema
```typescript
export const createAllergySchema = Joi.object({
  studentId: Joi.string().uuid().required(),
  allergen: Joi.string().trim().min(2).max(200).required(),
  severity: Joi.string().valid('MILD', 'MODERATE', 'SEVERE', 'LIFE_THREATENING').required(),
  reaction: Joi.string().trim().max(1000).optional(),
  treatment: Joi.string().trim().max(1000).optional(),
  verified: Joi.boolean().optional(),
  verifiedBy: Joi.string().trim().optional()
});
```
