# Security Standards and Guidelines

## General Security Principles
- Follow the principle of least privilege for all access controls
- Implement defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Never store sensitive data in plain text or client-side code
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities

## Authentication and Authorization
- Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication
- Use secure session management with proper timeouts
- Store passwords using strong hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use secure token-based authentication (JWT with proper validation)

## Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Implement proper data classification and handling procedures
- Follow GDPR, HIPAA, or other relevant privacy regulations
- Securely dispose of sensitive data when no longer needed

## Input Validation and Sanitization
- Validate all inputs on both client and server side
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Sanitize data before rendering to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement proper file upload restrictions and validation
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

## API Security
- Implement proper authentication for all API endpoints
- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- Validate and sanitize all API inputs
- Log security events and monitor for suspicious activity
- Use CORS policies appropriately

## Dependency and Infrastructure Security
- Keep all dependencies and packages up to date
- Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities
- Use security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Secure configuration management and environment variables

## Incident Response
- Have a documented incident response plan
- Log security events with appropriate detail
- Monitor for security breaches and anomalies
- Implement alerting for critical security events
- Regularly test and update security procedures
