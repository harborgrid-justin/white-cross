## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Safe to Implement)
- ✅ Error Code System - Non-breaking
- ✅ Type Utilities - Additive only
- ✅ Persistent Options - Independent
- ✅ Theme System - UI only

### Medium Risk (Requires Testing)
- ⚠️ Auto-Generated Hooks - Needs build process
- ⚠️ Permission Management - Affects all routes
- ⚠️ Token Authentication - Auth system change
- ⚠️ Notification System - New infrastructure

### High Risk (Needs Careful Planning)
- 🔴 Redux Migration - Large state refactor
- 🔴 Component Library Reorg - Affects all components
- 🔴 gRPC Adoption - Major architectural change

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Rollout:** Implement one feature at a time
2. **Feature Flags:** Use flags for new features
3. **Parallel Systems:** Run old and new side-by-side during migration
4. **Comprehensive Testing:** Full test coverage before deployment
5. **Rollback Plan:** Easy to revert if issues occur
