## Browser Installation Status

**Status**: ⚠ NOT COMPLETED

The Playwright browser installation encountered network restrictions (403 errors). The browsers need to be installed manually when network access is available.

### To Install Browsers:

```bash
# Install all browsers
npx playwright install

# Or install specific browsers
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright install firefox
npx playwright install webkit

# Install with system dependencies (Linux)
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### Verify Installation:

```bash
# Check Playwright version
npx playwright --version

# Run example test to verify setup
npm run playwright tests/e2e/example.spec.ts
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Browsers
Run the installation commands above when network access is available.

### 2. Verify Setup
```bash
# Run the example test
npm run playwright tests/e2e/example.spec.ts

# Or run in UI mode
npm run playwright:ui
```

### 3. Start Migration
Begin migrating Cypress tests from `/home/user/white-cross/frontend/cypress/e2e/` to Playwright:

1. Pick a Cypress test file (e.g., `auth-flow.cy.ts`)
2. Create corresponding Playwright test (e.g., `auth-flow.spec.ts`)
3. Use MIGRATION_GUIDE.md as reference
4. Follow the patterns in `example.spec.ts`
5. Use converter utilities from `cypress-to-playwright-converter.ts`

### 4. Migration Tips

**Start with simple tests:**
- Authentication flows
- Navigation tests
- Basic form submissions

**Use custom fixtures:**
```typescript
test('example', async ({ nursePage }) => {
  await nursePage.goto('/students');
  // Test automatically has nurse authentication
});
```

**Leverage helper functions:**
```typescript
import { login, logout } from '../support/auth-helpers';
import { typeIntoField, clickButton } from '../support/test-helpers';
import { USERS, MOCK_STUDENTS } from '../support/fixtures';
```

### 5. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all Playwright tests
npm run playwright

# Run with UI (recommended for development)
npm run playwright:ui

# Run specific test file
npm run playwright tests/e2e/example.spec.ts

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run playwright:headed

# Debug mode
npm run playwright:debug
```

## Migration Progress

- **Total Cypress Tests**: 248 files
- **Migrated to Playwright**: 1 (example.spec.ts)
- **Remaining**: 247

## Key Differences from Cypress

1. **Async/Await**: All Playwright actions are async and require `await`
2. **Auto-waiting**: Playwright automatically waits for elements (smarter than Cypress)
3. **Locators**: Use `page.locator()` instead of `cy.get()`
4. **Assertions**: Use `expect()` from `@playwright/test`
5. **Fixtures**: Custom fixtures replace `beforeEach()` for authentication
6. **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel by default (faster!)
7. **Multiple Browsers**: Easily test across chromium, firefox, webkit

## Configuration Highlights

- **Base URL**: http://localhost:5173 (from Cypress config)
- **Timeout Settings**: Match Cypress settings (60s page load, 10s commands)
- **Retry Logic**: 2 retries in CI mode (matching Cypress)
- **Video Recording**: Only on failures (matching Cypress)
- **Screenshot**: On failures (matching Cypress)
- **Viewport**: 1440x900 (from Cypress config)

## Healthcare-Specific Features

All healthcare-specific test utilities from Cypress are preserved:

- Authentication with multiple user roles
- PHI access logging verification
- Medication five rights validation
- Audit log verification
- HIPAA compliance checks
- Healthcare data mocking (students, medications, appointments)
