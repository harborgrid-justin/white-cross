## Browser Installation

**Status:** ⚠ PENDING (Network Restrictions)

The browser installation encountered network access restrictions. Install browsers manually:

```bash
# Install all browsers
npx playwright install

# Or specific browsers
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright install firefox
npx playwright install webkit

# With system dependencies (Linux)
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

## How to Use the Infrastructure

### 1. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run playwright

# Run with UI (recommended)
npm run playwright:ui

# Run specific test
npm run playwright tests/e2e/01-authentication/04-successful-login.spec.ts

# Run in headed mode
npm run playwright:headed

# Debug mode
npm run playwright:debug
```

### 2. Use Custom Fixtures

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '../setup/base-test';

test.describe('Student Management', () => {
  test('nurse can view students', async ({ nursePage }) => {
    await nursePage.goto('/students');
    await expect(nursePage.locator('h1')).toContainText('Students');
  });
});
```

### 3. Use Helper Functions

```typescript
import { login, logout } from '../support/auth-helpers';
import { setupHealthcareMocks, typeIntoField } from '../support/test-helpers';
import { USERS, MOCK_STUDENTS } from '../support/fixtures';
import { assertToastMessage } from '../support/custom-matchers';

test('example', async ({ page }) => {
  await setupHealthcareMocks(page);
  await login(page, 'nurse');
  await page.goto('/students');
  // Test logic...
});
```

### 4. Mock API Responses

```typescript
test('mock student data', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.route('**/api/students', async (route) => {
    await route.fulfill({
      status: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        success: true,
        data: { students: MOCK_STUDENTS }
      })
    });
  });
});
```
