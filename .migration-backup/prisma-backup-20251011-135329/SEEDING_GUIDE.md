# White Cross Database Seeding Guide

This guide explains how to use the comprehensive database seeding system for the White Cross healthcare platform.

## Overview

The seeding system consists of three main components:

1. **Base Seed** (`seed.ts`) - Core data including users, students, schools, medications, and basic health records
2. **Enhanced Seed** (`seed.enhanced.ts`) - Additional comprehensive health data (vaccinations, screenings, growth measurements, vital signs)
3. **Database Reset** (`reset-database.ts`) - Utility to clear and re-seed the database

## Quick Start

### Seed Fresh Database

```bash
# From backend directory
cd backend

# Run base seed only
npm run seed

# Run enhanced seed (requires base seed to be run first)
npm run seed:enhanced

# Run both base and enhanced seeds
npm run db:seed-all
```

### Reset and Re-seed Database

```bash
# Reset database and re-seed (DESTRUCTIVE!)
npm run db:reset
```

## Advanced Usage

### Running Seeds Programmatically

```typescript
import { execSync } from 'child_process';

// Run base seed
execSync('npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts', { stdio: 'inherit' });

// Run enhanced seed
execSync('npx ts-node prisma/seed.enhanced.ts', { stdio: 'inherit' });
```

### Customizing Seed Data

Edit the seed files directly:

**Adjust student count** (seed.ts, line ~706):
```typescript
for (let batch = 0; batch < 10; batch++) {  // Change 10 to desired batches
  const batchSize = 50;  // Change batch size
```

**Modify vaccination compliance** (seed.enhanced.ts, line ~92):
```typescript
const vaccinations = dueVaccines
  .filter(() => randomBool(0.9))  // Change 0.9 (90%) to desired rate
```

**Adjust allergy prevalence** (seed.ts, line ~858):
```typescript
const studentsWithAllergies = students.filter(() => Math.random() < 0.2);  // 20%
```

### Data Integrity Checks

After seeding, verify data integrity:

```sql
-- Check referential integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students WHERE nurseId IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emergency_contacts;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vaccinations;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM health_records;

-- Check for orphaned records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students WHERE nurseId NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "No students found"

**Problem**: Running enhanced seed without base seed.

**Solution**:
```bash
npm run seed          # Run base seed first
npm run seed:enhanced # Then run enhanced seed
```

### Error: "Unique constraint failed"

**Problem**: Trying to re-run seed without clearing database.

**Solution**:
```bash
npm run db:reset  # Clear and re-seed
```

### Error: "Database connection failed"

**Problem**: Database not running or incorrect connection string.

**Solution**:
1. Check `.env` file for correct `DATABASE_URL`
2. Ensure PostgreSQL is running
3. Test connection: `npx prisma db push`

### Slow Seed Performance

**Problem**: Seeding takes too long.

**Solutions**:
- Reduce batch sizes in seed files
- Run base seed only (skip enhanced)
- Optimize database connection pool
- Use local PostgreSQL instance

---

## Best Practices

1. **Development**:
   - Use `npm run db:reset` to get fresh data
   - Run enhanced seed only when testing comprehensive features
   - Keep test accounts separate from production accounts

2. **Testing**:
   - Use test accounts for automated testing
   - Reset database before running E2E test suites
   - Verify seed data matches test expectations

3. **Production**:
   - NEVER run reset script in production
   - Use migrations for schema changes
   - Seed only initial lookup/reference data

4. **HIPAA Compliance**:
   - All seed data is fake/synthetic
   - No real patient health information (PHI)
   - Safe for development and testing

---

## Extending the Seeds

To add new seed data:

1. Add data generation logic to appropriate seed file
2. Follow existing patterns for batching and progress reporting
3. Respect foreign key relationships
4. Use realistic, HIPAA-compliant fake data
5. Update this documentation

Example:
```typescript
// In seed.enhanced.ts
console.log('Creating Custom Data...');
const customData = await Promise.all(
  students.map(student =>
    prisma.customTable.create({
      data: {
        studentId: student.id,
        // ... custom fields
      }
    })
  )
);
console.log(`â Created ${customData.length} custom records\n`);
```

---

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check this documentation
2. Review seed file comments
3. Consult Prisma schema (`schema.prisma`)
4. Check logs for specific error messages
