# Cypress E2E Test Failure Report - White Cross Healthcare Platform
**Generated**: October 10, 2025
**Test Run Duration**: 03:01 (3 minutes 1 second)
**Environment**: Headless Electron 138, Windows Platform

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Test Results
- **Total Test Specs**: 151 files
- **Total Tests**: 2,478 individual tests
- **Passing Tests**: 1 test (0.04%)
- **Failing Tests**: 274 tests (11.06%)
- **Skipped Tests**: 2,199 tests (88.7%)
- **Screenshots Captured**: 151 failure screenshots
- **Success Rate**: **0.04%** (CRITICAL FAILURE)

### Critical Blocker Identified
**All tests are failing** due to a single critical import/export error affecting the entire application:

```
SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/services/modules/healthRecordsApi.ts'
does not provide an export named 'CircuitBreakerError'
```

This error originates from your application code and prevents Cypress from even beginning test execution. The error occurs during **session setup** in the `before each` hook, causing all subsequent tests to be skipped.

---

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Primary Issue: Module Export Error

**Location**: `F:/temp/white-cross/frontend/src/services/modules/healthRecordsApi.ts`

**Problem**: The file DOES export `CircuitBreakerError` (lines 2097-2102):
```typescript
export class CircuitBreakerError extends HealthRecordsApiError {
  constructor(message: string = 'Service temporarily unavailable') {
    super(message, 503, 'CIRCUIT_BREAKER_OPEN');
    this.name = 'CircuitBreakerError';
  }
}
```

However, the module is being imported with named imports that are failing during Vite's development server processing. This is likely caused by:

1. **Circular dependency issues** - The healthRecordsApi module may have circular imports
2. **ESM/CommonJS mismatch** - Vite's build process may be encountering module resolution issues
3. **Missing exports** - The file exports `CircuitBreakerError` but does NOT export `healthRecordsApiService` which is being imported by hooks

**Affected Files**:
- `src/hooks/useHealthRecords.ts` (line 22: imports CircuitBreakerError)
- `src/components/healthRecords/HealthRecordsErrorBoundary.tsx` (line 20: imports CircuitBreakerError)

### Secondary Issues

1. **Missing Service Export**: The hook `useHealthRecords.ts` imports `healthRecordsApiService` from `healthRecordsApi.ts`, but this service is NOT exported from that file.

2. **Session Management**: Every test attempts to create a session with credentials:
   - Email: `nurse@school.edu`
   - Password: `NursePassword123!`

   The session creation fails immediately due to the module error.

---

## DETAILED TEST BREAKDOWN

### Test Execution Pattern
All 151 test files followed the same failure pattern:

1. Test file loads
2. `before each` hook attempts to set up session
3. Module import error occurs
4. Test suite fails immediately
5. All remaining tests in suite are skipped

### Sample Failure Pattern (Repeated Across All Files)

**File**: `06-incident-reporting.cy.ts`
```
Incident Reporting
  Page Load & Structure
    ✗ "before each" hook for "should display incident reports page with proper structure"

SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/services/modules/healthRecordsApi.ts'
does not provide an export named 'CircuitBreakerError'

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your application code,
it will automatically fail the current test.

This error occurred while creating the session. Because the session setup failed,
we failed the test.
```

**Result**: 43 tests in file, 0 passing, 1 failing, 42 skipped

This pattern repeated across **all 151 test spec files**.

- Session setup fails before any test can run

### Category 2: Session Management Failures (Indirect)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Impact**: Authentication flow blocked
**Affected Tests**: All tests requiring authentication

**Issue**: Cannot establish test session due to module error
**Root Cause**: Error occurs during session creation in `before each` hooks

### Category 3: Missing Test Data
**Priority**: MEDIUM (Cannot assess due to Category 1)
**Impact**: Unknown - tests never reach execution
**Affected Tests**: Unknown

**Issue**: Cannot determine missing test IDs, elements, or API issues because application won't load

---

## RECOMMENDED FIXES

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (Priority: CRITICAL)

#### Fix 1: Resolve Export Issues in healthRecordsApi.ts

**File**: `F:/temp/white-cross/frontend/src/services/modules/healthRecordsApi.ts`

**Issue 1 - Missing Service Instance Export**:
The file exports the `HealthRecordsApi` class and a singleton instance `healthRecordsApi`, but hooks are trying to import `healthRecordsApiService`.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// At the end of healthRecordsApi.ts (line 2123), ADD:
export const healthRecordsApiService = healthRecordsApi;
```

**Issue 2 - Circular Import Detection**:
Check for circular dependencies:

```bash
# Run from frontend directory
npx madge --circular src/
```

**Solution if circular deps found**: Refactor to break circular dependencies by:
- Moving shared types to a separate file
- Creating a barrel export pattern
- Using dynamic imports where appropriate

#### Fix 2: Update Import Statements

**File**: `F:/temp/white-cross/frontend/src/hooks/useHealthRecords.ts` (line 21-41)

**Current Import** (lines 21-41):
```typescript
import {
  healthRecordsApiService,
  HealthRecord,
  Allergy,
  // ... other imports
  CircuitBreakerError,
  PaginatedResponse,
  HealthAlert,
} from '../services/modules/healthRecordsApi';
```

**Verify that all these exports exist** in healthRecordsApi.ts:
- ✅ `CircuitBreakerError` - EXISTS (line 2097)
- ❌ `healthRecordsApiService` - DOES NOT EXIST
- ❓ `HealthAlert` - Need to verify

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Option A: Use the correct export name
import {
  healthRecordsApi as healthRecordsApiService,
  // ... rest of imports
} from '../services/modules/healthRecordsApi';

// Option B: Add the missing export (recommended)
// Add to healthRecordsApi.ts:
export const healthRecordsApiService = healthRecordsApi;
```

#### Fix 3: Verify Module Resolution

**File**: `F:/temp/white-cross/frontend/vite.config.ts`

Ensure Vite is configured correctly for TypeScript module resolution:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
  // Ensure proper handling of TypeScript
  esbuild: {
    logOverride: { 'this-is-undefined-in-esm': 'silent' }
  }
})
```

#### Fix 4: Clear Build Cache

```bash
# From frontend directory
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
rm -rf dist
npm run build
```

### SECONDARY ACTIONS (Priority: HIGH)

#### Action 1: Verify Backend Server

The tests expect the backend to be running at `http://localhost:3001`. Ensure:
- Backend server is running
- Database is accessible
- Test user exists with credentials:
  - Email: `nurse@school.edu`
  - Password: `NursePassword123!`

#### Action 2: Review Cypress Custom Commands

**File**: `F:/temp/white-cross/frontend/cypress/support/commands.ts`

The session creation logic likely exists here. After fixing the module error, verify:
- Session command is properly implemented
- Authentication flow works correctly
- Session persistence is configured

---

## TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Blocker (Estimated: 1-2 hours)
1. Add missing export for `healthRecordsApiService`
2. Verify all exports in `healthRecordsApi.ts`
3. Clear caches and rebuild
4. Test application loads in browser (http://localhost:5173)
5. Verify no console errors related to imports

### Phase 2: Re-run Test Suite (Estimated: 30 minutes)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e
```

Expected outcome after fix:
- Tests should begin executing
- New failures will emerge (missing test IDs, elements, etc.)
- Create follow-up report for actual test failures

### Phase 3: Systematic Test Repair (Estimated: 2-3 days)
Once the blocker is fixed, expect to address:
1. **Missing data-testid attributes** - Add to components
2. **Missing DOM elements** - Update component implementations
3. **API mocking** - Configure Cypress intercepts
4. **Timing issues** - Add proper waits and retries
5. **Component rendering** - Fix conditional rendering logic

## APPENDIX A: Error Evidence

### Complete Error Stack Trace
```
SyntaxError: The following error originated from your application code, not from Cypress.

> The requested module '/src/services/modules/healthRecordsApi.ts' does not provide an export named 'CircuitBreakerError'

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your application it will automatically fail the current test.

This behavior is configurable, and you can choose to turn this off by listening to the `uncaught:exception` event.

https://on.cypress.io/uncaught-exception-from-application

This error occurred while creating the session. Because the session setup failed, we failed the test.

Because this error occurred during a `before each` hook we are skipping the remaining tests in the current suite: [Suite Name]
```
