## Technical Architecture

### Backend Structure

#### Service Layer (`backend/src/services/reportService.ts`)
- `ReportService` class with static methods
- Prisma ORM for database queries
- Efficient SQL queries with grouping and aggregation
- Raw SQL for complex analytics
- Error handling and logging

#### Route Layer (`backend/src/routes/reports.ts`)
- RESTful API endpoints
- Query parameter handling
- Request validation
- Consistent response format
- Error responses

#### Integration (`backend/src/index.ts`)
- Registered at `/api/reports`
- Protected by authentication middleware
- Rate limiting applied

### Frontend Structure

#### API Service (`frontend/src/services/reportsApi.ts`)
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Axios-based HTTP client
- Centralized API calls
- Error handling

#### UI Component (`frontend/src/pages/Reports.tsx`)
- Tab-based navigation (8 tabs)
- React Query for data fetching
- Real-time updates
- Date range filtering
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Export functionality
- Responsive design

### Tab Structure
1. **Overview** - Summary of all analytics capabilities
2. **Health Analytics** - Health trends and population insights
3. **Medication Reports** - Medication usage and compliance
4. **Incident Statistics** - Safety analytics and trends
5. **Attendance Analysis** - Correlation analysis
6. **Real-time Dashboard** - Live performance metrics
7. **Compliance** - Regulatory compliance reports
8. **Custom Reports** - Report builder interface

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Tab-Based Navigation**: Provides clear separation of concerns and easy navigation between different report types.

2. **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard automatically refreshes every 30 seconds to provide live metrics.

3. **Date Range Filtering**: Consistent across all report types for easy time-based analysis.

4. **Lazy Loading**: Reports only fetch data when their tab is active, improving performance.

5. **Graceful Error Handling**: Backend errors are caught and displayed to users without breaking the UI.

6. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across the entire stack.

7. **Responsive Design**: Uses Tailwind CSS grid system for mobile-friendly layouts.

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/reports/health-trends` | GET | Health trend analysis |
| `/api/reports/medication-usage` | GET | Medication reports |
| `/api/reports/incident-statistics` | GET | Incident analytics |
| `/api/reports/attendance-correlation` | GET | Attendance analysis |
| `/api/reports/performance-metrics` | GET | Performance metrics |
| `/api/reports/dashboard` | GET | Real-time dashboard |
| `/api/reports/compliance` | GET | Compliance reports |
| `/api/reports/custom` | POST | Custom report generation |
| `/api/reports/export` | POST | Data export |

## Database Queries

The implementation leverages:
- **Prisma GroupBy**: For aggregations and statistics
- **Prisma Include**: For relational data
- **Raw SQL**: For complex analytics (monthly trends)
- **Efficient Indexing**: Using existing database indexes

## Security & Compliance

- All endpoints require authentication
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- HIPAA audit logging for data access
- No sensitive data in URLs
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Query Limits**: Large result sets are limited (e.g., take: 100)
2. **Indexed Fields**: Queries use indexed fields for fast lookups
3. **Aggregation**: Database-level aggregation reduces data transfer
4. **Caching**: React Query caches results to reduce API calls
5. **Lazy Loading**: Data fetched only when needed

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- TypeScript compilation checks
- Frontend build verification
- UI testing with Playwright
- Visual verification with screenshots

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Data visualization with charts (Chart.js, Recharts)
2. Scheduled report generation and email delivery
3. Advanced filtering with multiple criteria
4. Report templates and saved configurations
5. PDF generation with formatting
6. Excel export with multiple sheets
7. Real-time WebSocket updates for dashboard
8. Custom dashboard widget configuration
