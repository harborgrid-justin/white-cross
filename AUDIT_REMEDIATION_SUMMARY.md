// Medical codes with validation
type ICD10Code = string & { readonly __brand: 'ICD10Code' };
type NPICode = string & { readonly __brand: 'NPICode' };

// Mark data as PHI
const diagnosis: PHI<string> = markAsPHI('Type 1 Diabetes');

// Validate medical codes
const icd10 = createICD10Code('E11.9'); // Validated format
const npi = createNPICode('1234567893'); // Includes checksum

// De-identify for research
const deIdentified = deIdentifyPHI(record, 'full');

  // ...
};

// AFTER - Full type safety
const getStudentsHandler = createHandler<GetStudentsQuery, never, never, Student[]>(
  async (request, h) => {
    // TypeScript knows exact types
    const page = parseInt(request.query.page?.toString() || '1');
    const userId = request.auth.credentials.userId; // Typed!
    // ...
  }
);
```

**Impact:**
