## Screenshot Details

### Resolution
- **Viewport**: 1920x1080 pixels
- **Format**: PNG
- **Type**: Full page screenshots (includes content below fold)

### Access Control Demonstration

The screenshots demonstrate role-based access control (RBAC):

1. **Admin Role** (17 screenshots)
   - Full access to all features
   - Can access user/role management
   - Can access budget features

2. **Nurse Role** (10 screenshots)
   - Access to healthcare features
   - Access to inventory management
   - Can generate reports
   - Cannot access admin/budget features

3. **Counselor Role** (3 screenshots)
   - Limited access
   - Can view dashboard and health records
   - Most other features show access denied

4. **Viewer Role** (3 screenshots)
   - Read-only access
   - Similar to counselor but explicitly read-only
   - Most features show access denied

### Use Cases

These screenshots are valuable for:

1. **Documentation**: Visual guide for user manual and training materials
2. **Testing**: Visual regression testing baseline
3. **Demos**: Sales presentations and stakeholder demos
4. **Onboarding**: New developer orientation
5. **Compliance**: Audit trails showing UI state
6. **Design Review**: UI/UX consistency checks
7. **Bug Reports**: Attach screenshots showing UI state
8. **Release Notes**: Show new features visually

## Customization

To capture different pages, edit the `ROUTES` object in `generate-screenshots.ts`:

```typescript
const ROUTES = {
  public: [
    { path: '/login', name: 'login-page', description: 'Login Page' },
    // Add more public routes
  ],
  common: [
    { path: '/dashboard', name: 'dashboard', description: 'Dashboard' },
    // Add more routes accessible to all authenticated users
  ],
  nurse: [
    // Add nurse-specific routes
  ],
  admin: [
    // Add admin-specific routes
  ],
};
```

## Performance

On a typical development machine:
- **Time to complete**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Browser instances**: 5 (one for public + one per role)
- **Memory usage**: ~500MB peak
- **Disk space**: ~5-10MB for all screenshots
