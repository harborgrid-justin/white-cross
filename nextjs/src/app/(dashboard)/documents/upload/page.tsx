/**
 * @fileoverview Secure Document Upload Page - HIPAA-compliant file upload interface
 *
 * This page provides a secure, encrypted file upload interface for healthcare documents.
 * All uploads are validated, virus-scanned, encrypted, and logged for HIPAA compliance.
 * The system supports multiple file formats, batch uploads, and automatic metadata extraction.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - Drag-and-drop file upload with progress tracking
 * - Multi-file batch upload support
 * - Client-side file validation before upload
 * - Server-side virus scanning (ClamAV or similar)
 * - Automatic encryption at rest (AES-256)
 * - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
 * - Automatic file type detection and categorization
 * - OCR for scanned documents (optional)
 * - Metadata extraction (dates, patient names, etc.)
 * - Document categorization and tagging
 * - Audit logging for all uploads
 *
 * **File Upload Architecture:**
 * 1. **Client-Side Validation**:
 *    - File size check (max 50MB per file)
 *    - File type validation against whitelist
 *    - File name sanitization
 *    - Basic malware signature check
 *
 * 2. **Upload Process**:
 *    - File chunked for large files (>5MB)
 *    - MD5 hash computed for integrity verification
 *    - Upload to temporary staging area
 *    - Progress tracking with real-time updates
 *    - Retry mechanism for failed uploads
 *
 * 3. **Server-Side Processing**:
 *    - Virus scanning with ClamAV or similar
 *    - File type verification (magic number check)
 *    - Encryption with AES-256-GCM
 *    - Move to permanent storage (S3-compatible)
 *    - Thumbnail generation for images/PDFs
 *    - Metadata extraction and indexing
 *    - Full-text indexing for searchability
 *
 * 4. **Post-Upload**:
 *    - Database record creation
 *    - Audit log entry
 *    - User notification
 *    - Optional OCR processing queue
 *    - Integration with EHR systems
 *
 * **Supported File Types:**
 * - **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF
 * - **Images**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP
 * - **Spreadsheets**: XLS, XLSX, CSV
 * - **Medical Imaging**: DICOM (with specialized viewer)
 * - **Archives**: ZIP (will be extracted and scanned)
 *
 * **File Size Limits:**
 * - Single file: 50 MB maximum
 * - Batch upload: 200 MB total
 * - Medical images: 100 MB per DICOM file
 * - Configurable via environment variables
 *
 * **Security Measures:**
 * - **Virus Scanning**: All files scanned before storage
 * - **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256-GCM with unique keys per file
 * - **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all transfers
 * - **Access Control**: Upload requires 'documents:upload' permission
 * - **Audit Logging**: All uploads logged with user, timestamp, IP
 * - **File Integrity**: MD5 hash verification on upload and download
 * - **Secure File Names**: All file names sanitized to prevent path traversal
 *
 * **HIPAA Compliance:**
 * - All PHI documents encrypted per HIPAA Security Rule
 * - Audit trail maintained for all uploads (HIPAA Privacy Rule)
 * - Access controls enforce minimum necessary principle
 * - Automatic classification of PHI vs non-PHI documents
 * - Document retention policies automatically applied
 * - Secure deletion when retention period expires
 *
 * **Upload Validation:**
 * - File extension matches MIME type
 * - File size within acceptable limits
 * - No malicious code patterns detected
 * - Required metadata fields present
 * - User has permission to upload to selected category
 * - Duplicate detection (optional)
 *
 * **Error Handling:**
 * - Invalid file type: Clear error message with allowed types
 * - File too large: Show size limit and suggest compression
 * - Virus detected: File rejected, incident logged, admin notified
 * - Network error: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
 * - Storage quota exceeded: Notify user and admin

/**
 * Secure Document Upload Page Component
 *
 * Server component that renders the document upload interface with comprehensive
 * security features, validation, and progress tracking. All uploads are encrypted,
 * virus-scanned, and logged for HIPAA compliance.
 *
 * **Upload Workflow:**
 * 1. User drags files or clicks to select from file picker
 * 2. Client-side validation checks file type and size
 * 3. User selects document category and adds metadata
 * 4. File upload begins with progress indicator
 * 5. Server receives file and performs virus scan
 * 6. File encrypted and stored in secure storage
 * 7. Metadata indexed in database for searchability
 * 8. User notified of successful upload
 * 9. Document appears in document library immediately
 * 10. Audit log entry created
 *
 * **Upload Features:**
 * - **Drag and Drop**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
 * - **Multi-File**: Upload multiple files simultaneously
 * - **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress for each file
 * - **Metadata Entry**: Add category, tags, description during upload
 * - **Preview**: Preview images and PDFs before upload
 * - **Validation**: Instant feedback on file type and size issues
 * - **Retry**: Automatic retry for failed uploads
 *
 * **Security Features:**
 * - Files never stored unencrypted on server
 * - All uploads go through virus scanning
 * - File content validated against declared MIME type
 * - Path traversal attacks prevented via file name sanitization
 * - Upload rate limiting to prevent abuse
 * - CSRF protection for upload form
 *
 * **Metadata Collection:**
 * During upload, users provide:
 * - Document category (consent, medical record, etc.)
 * - Document title (auto-generated from filename if not provided)
 * - Description (optional)
 * - Tags for searchability
 * - Associated patient (if applicable)
 * - Privacy classification (PHI/non-PHI)
 *
 * **Upload Optimization:**
 * - Large files automatically chunked for reliability
 * - Parallel uploads for multiple files
 * - Compression for compatible file types
 * - Resumable uploads for large files (if connection drops)
 * - Client-side thumbnail generation to reduce server load
 *
 * **Access Control:**
 * - Requires 'documents:upload' permission
 * - Some categories may require elevated permissions
 * - Upload quota enforced per user/organization
 * - File type restrictions configurable per role
 *
 * **Post-Upload Processing:**
 * - **OCR**: Scanned documents queued for text extraction
 * - **Thumbnail**: Generate preview thumbnails for UI
 * - **Full-Text Index**: Extract text for search functionality
 * - **EXIF Stripping**: Remove metadata from images for privacy
 * - **PDF Optimization**: Compress PDFs while maintaining readability

 * // 5. Select associated student from dropdown
 * // 6. Click "Upload"
 * // 7. Watch progress bar as file uploads
 * // 8. Receive confirmation when complete
 * // 9. Document appears in library with proper categorization

 * @example
 * // Administrator uploads batch of consent forms
 * // 1. Navigate to /documents/upload
 * // 2. Select multiple PDF files (20 consent forms)
 * // 3. Select category: "Consent Forms"
 * // 4. Add bulk tags: "consent", "2025", "fieldtrip"
 * // 5. Click "Upload All"
 * // 6. Monitor progress for all 20 files
 * // 7. All files uploaded, encrypted, and cataloged
 * // 8. Bulk operations available in document library
