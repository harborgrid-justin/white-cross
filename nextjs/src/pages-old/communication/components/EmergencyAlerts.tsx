/**
 * @component EmergencyAlerts
 * Dashboard component for managing emergency alerts with real-time delivery tracking
 * and recipient response monitoring.
 *
 * Provides a comprehensive view of all emergency alerts sent through the system,
 * including delivery status across multiple channels, read receipts, and recipient
 * acknowledgments. Essential for school nurses and administrators to verify that
 * critical communications have reached intended recipients.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Basic usage in communication dashboard
 * <EmergencyAlerts />
 *
 * // With custom styling
 * <EmergencyAlerts className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6" />
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## Alert Management Features
 * - **Real-Time Status**: Live updates on delivery and read status via WebSocket
 * - **Multi-Channel Tracking**: Separate status for SMS, email, push, and voice delivery
 * - **Recipient Acknowledgment**: Track which parents/staff have confirmed receipt
 * - **Resend Capability**: Option to resend failed deliveries to specific recipients
 * - **Alert Analytics**: View delivery rates, response times, and engagement metrics
 * - **Filter and Search**: Find alerts by date, category, status, or recipient group
 *
 * ## Delivery Status Indicators
 * - **Sent**: Alert queued for delivery across all channels
 * - **Delivered**: Confirmed delivery to recipient's device/inbox
 * - **Read**: Recipient has opened/viewed the alert
 * - **Acknowledged**: Recipient has confirmed understanding (if required)
 * - **Failed**: Delivery failure (invalid number, bounced email, etc.)
 *
 * ## Redux Integration
 * - Connected to communication Redux slice for alert state
 * - Real-time updates via WebSocket for delivery status changes

 * - Background refetch every 30 seconds for status updates
 * - Optimistic updates for alert actions (resend, cancel)
 * - Infinite scroll for large alert history
 *
 * ## Compliance Features
 * - Complete audit trail of all alert activities
 * - HIPAA-compliant logging of alert access and modifications
 * - Retention policy enforcement for old alerts
 * - Export capability for compliance reporting
