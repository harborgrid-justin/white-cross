**Task ID:** P3D7K9-dashboard-typescript-fixes
**Started:** 2025-11-01
**Completed:** 2025-11-01
**Status:** Completed

## Current Phase: TypeScript Error Fixes

### Completed
- ✓ Checked `.temp/` directory for existing agent work
- ✓ Identified core dashboard files (117 files excluding admin/patients/inventory/appointments)
- ✓ Created tracking documents with unique ID P3D7K9
- ✓ Analyzed TypeScript errors - discovered root cause
- ✓ Fixed TypeScript dependency installation (npm install completed)
- ✓ Baseline: 247 TypeScript errors in core dashboard files (2713 total)
- ✓ Fixed implicit 'any' types in incidents pages (11 files)
- ✓ Fixed incidents/trending page with proper type interfaces

### Key Discovery
**Critical Finding:** TypeScript lib files were missing from node_modules, causing infrastructure errors. After reinstalling dependencies, identified 247 actual code-level type errors in core dashboard files.

### Error Breakdown by Type
- TS2322 (Type assignment): 107 errors
- TS2304 (Cannot find name): 34 errors
- TS18046 (Possibly undefined): 22 errors
- TS7006 (Implicit any): 19 errors
- TS2339 (Property doesn't exist): 13 errors
