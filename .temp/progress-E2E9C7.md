# Progress Report - E2E Encryption Integration (E2E9C7)

## Current Phase
**Phase 0: Planning and Analysis** ✅

## Completed Work
1. ✅ Analyzed existing codebase structure
2. ✅ Reviewed encryption service implementation
3. ✅ Reviewed key management service implementation
4. ✅ Reviewed message service current state
5. ✅ Identified integration gaps
6. ✅ Created comprehensive plan
7. ✅ Created detailed checklist
8. ✅ Created architecture documentation

## Current Status
**Status**: Ready to begin Phase 1 - Model & Migration Updates

## Next Steps
1. Update Message model with encryption fields
2. Update Conversation model with encryption fields
3. Create database migration
4. Proceed to Phase 2: Encryption Initialization Service

## Blockers
None currently.

## Notes
- Encryption service is well-architected and production-ready
- Message service has basic encryption support but needs enhancement
- Need to ensure backward compatibility with existing unencrypted messages
- Focus on graceful error handling throughout integration
