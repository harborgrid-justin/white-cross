## Key Findings

### Critical Issues (Priority 1)
1. **Form Label Accessibility** - Missing htmlFor/id associations (WCAG violation)
2. **Inconsistent Page Headers** - Mixed implementations across pages
3. **Link Component Usage** - Using <a> tags instead of Next.js Link

### High Priority Issues (Priority 2)
4. **Empty State Inconsistency** - Varied implementations need standardization
5. **Stats Card Grid Layout** - Inconsistent grid configurations
6. **Loading State Variations** - Need skeleton screens and Suspense boundaries

### Medium Priority Issues (Priority 3)
7. **Keyboard Navigation** - Some clickable elements missing proper support
8. **Status Badge Standardization** - Inline colors instead of Badge component
9. **Container Component** - Inconsistent usage across pages
10. **ARIA Labels** - Missing on icon-only buttons and interactive elements
