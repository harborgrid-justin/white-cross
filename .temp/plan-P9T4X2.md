# Implementation Plan - Fix TypeScript Errors in Students/Patients Management

**Agent ID**: typescript-architect
**Task ID**: P9T4X2
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**References**: Builds on previous TypeScript fixes from agents (SF7K3W, C4D9F2, etc.)

## Objective
Fix all TypeScript errors in the students (patients) management components located in `src/app/(dashboard)/students/`

## Scope
1. Student list, details, and form components
2. Student records and medical history components
3. Fix implicit 'any' types on student/patient data
4. Add proper interfaces for student/patient data structures
5. Fix event handlers and form validation types

## Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis (15 min)
- Scan students directory for all TypeScript files
- Run TypeScript compiler to identify specific errors
- Categorize errors by type (implicit any, missing types, event handlers, etc.)

### Phase 2: Type Definitions (30 min)
- Create/update student/patient data interfaces
- Define form validation types
- Add event handler types
- Create medical history and records interfaces

### Phase 3: Component Fixes (45 min)
- Fix student list components
- Fix student detail components
- Fix student form components
- Fix medical records components
- Fix related actions and data files

### Phase 4: Validation (15 min)
- Run TypeScript compiler to verify error reduction
- Test type safety across components
- Document error reduction metrics

## Deliverables
- All TypeScript errors in students directory resolved
- Comprehensive type definitions for student/patient data
- Error reduction summary with before/after metrics
