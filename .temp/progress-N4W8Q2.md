# Progress Report - Middleware Consolidation - N4W8Q2

## Current Status: COMPLETED

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning ✓
- Scanned `.temp/` directory for existing agent work
- Generated unique tracking ID (N4W8Q2)
- Created all tracking documents (plan, checklist, task-status, architecture-notes)
- Analyzed all middleware implementations
- Identified `middleware.production.ts` as best implementation

### Phase 2: File Analysis ✓
- Read and analyzed `middleware.backup.ts`
- Read and analyzed `middleware.production.ts` (identical to backup)
- Read and analyzed `archive/middleware-variants/middleware.enhanced.ts`
- Read all modular components:
  - `/middleware/auth.ts` - Authentication logic
  - `/middleware/rbac.ts` - Role-based access control
  - `/middleware/security.ts` - Security headers and CORS
  - `/middleware/rateLimit.ts` - Rate limiting
  - `/middleware/audit.ts` - Audit logging
  - `/middleware/sanitization.ts` - Request sanitization
- Read security libraries:
  - `/lib/security/config.ts` - Security configuration
  - `/lib/security/csrf.ts` - CSRF token management

### Phase 3: Consolidation ✓
- Copied `middleware.production.ts` to `/src/middleware.ts`
- Verified file created successfully at correct location
- Confirmed all imports use correct relative paths (`./middleware/*`, `./lib/*`)
- Verified Next.js matcher configuration is correct

### Phase 4: Cleanup ✓
- Removed `/src/middleware.backup.ts`
- Removed `/src/middleware.production.ts`
- Preserved archive files for reference (`/archive/middleware-variants/`)
- Verified only single `middleware.ts` exists at src root

### Phase 5: Verification ✓
- Checked directory structure - correct
- Verified all modular components remain in `/src/middleware/`
- Verified security libraries remain in `/src/lib/security/`
- Confirmed Next.js conventions are followed

## Blockers
None encountered.

## Next Steps
- Update all tracking documents with completion status
- Create comprehensive completion summary
- Move all tracking files to `.temp/completed/`

## Notes
- Archive files preserved in `/archive/middleware-variants/` for reference
- All imports verified to work correctly from root location
- Middleware follows Next.js 13+ conventions with proper matcher
- Modular architecture maintained for better maintainability
