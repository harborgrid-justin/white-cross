**Date**: October 29, 2025

## Core Socket Service

- [ ] Create `/services/socket/` directory
- [ ] Implement `socket.config.ts` with environment settings
- [ ] Implement `socket.types.ts` with full TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Implement `socket.service.ts` with:
  - [ ] Socket.io client initialization
  - [ ] JWT authentication on connection
  - [ ] Singleton pattern
  - [ ] Event emitter methods
  - [ ] Connection methods (connect, disconnect, reconnect)

## Connection Management

- [ ] Implement `socket-manager.ts` with:
  - [ ] Connection state machine (DISCONNECTED, CONNECTING, CONNECTED, RECONNECTING, ERROR)
  - [ ] Exponential backoff algorithm
  - [ ] Max retry attempts
  - [ ] Heartbeat/ping-pong mechanism
  - [ ] Token refresh handling

## Event System

- [ ] Implement `socket-events.ts` with event handlers for:
  - [ ] message:received
  - [ ] message:delivered
  - [ ] message:read
  - [ ] message:typing
  - [ ] message:edited
  - [ ] message:deleted
  - [ ] connection:confirmed
  - [ ] connection:error
- [ ] Add event deduplication logic
- [ ] Add error handling per event type

## React Hooks

- [ ] Create `/hooks/socket/` directory
- [ ] Implement `useSocket.ts`:
  - [ ] Access socket instance
  - [ ] Connection state
  - [ ] Send message method
  - [ ] Proper cleanup
- [ ] Implement `useSocketEvent.ts`:
  - [ ] Generic event subscription
  - [ ] Type-safe event handlers
  - [ ] Automatic cleanup on unmount
- [ ] Implement `useSocketConnection.ts`:
  - [ ] Connection state tracking
  - [ ] Reconnect function
  - [ ] Connection health status

## Advanced Features

- [ ] Implement offline message queue:
  - [ ] Queue messages when disconnected
  - [ ] Send queued messages on reconnect
  - [ ] Persist queue to localStorage
- [ ] Implement message deduplication:
  - [ ] Track message IDs
  - [ ] Prevent duplicate delivery
  - [ ] Cleanup old message IDs
- [ ] Implement retry logic:
  - [ ] Retry failed sends
  - [ ] Exponential backoff for retries
  - [ ] Max retry attempts
- [ ] Add connection status indicators

## TypeScript & Quality

- [ ] Zero 'any' types (follow TS9A4F standards)
- [ ] Full interface definitions for all events
- [ ] Generic type parameters where appropriate
- [ ] JSDoc comments on public APIs
- [ ] Export all types from index file

## Testing & Validation

- [ ] Test connection lifecycle
- [ ] Test reconnection with backoff
- [ ] Test event subscription/unsubscription
- [ ] Test offline queue
- [ ] Test message deduplication
- [ ] Test memory leak prevention
- [ ] Verify TypeScript compilation

## Documentation

- [ ] Create README for socket service
- [ ] Document all event types
- [ ] Provide usage examples
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Add integration guide

## Integration

- [ ] Integrate with existing auth service
- [ ] Test with backend WebSocket endpoint
- [ ] Verify token authentication
- [ ] Test token refresh flow
