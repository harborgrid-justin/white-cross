# Progress Report: Next.js Special Files Implementation
**Task ID**: RC9X4K
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-31

## Current Phase
**Completed** - All phases complete

## Completed Work
- ✓ Reviewed existing error.tsx pattern (comprehensive JSDoc, healthcare theme)
- ✓ Reviewed existing not-found.tsx pattern (metadata, Tailwind CSS)
- ✓ Identified project structure (admin at `/admin`, dashboard at `/(dashboard)`)
- ✓ Created tracking files (task-status, plan, checklist, progress)
- ✓ Created root unauthorized.tsx with authentication messaging
- ✓ Created dashboard unauthorized.tsx with dashboard-specific context
- ✓ Created root forbidden.tsx with permission/access messaging
- ✓ Created admin forbidden.tsx with admin-specific security messaging
- ✓ Checked for parallel routes: None found (no default.tsx needed)
- ✓ Validated TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✓ Verified 'use client' directives: All files compliant
- ✓ Verified metadata exports: All files have metadata
- ✓ Verified healthcare theme: All files use healthcare-button classes

## Final Status
**SUCCESS**: All Next.js special files for auth errors (401/403) have been successfully created and validated.

**Key Findings**:
- Project uses comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Healthcare theme with Tailwind CSS
- Custom classes: `healthcare-button-primary`, `healthcare-button-secondary`
- Error components are client components ('use client')
- Metadata exports for SEO
- No parallel routes found (no @ prefix directories)

## Next Steps
1. Create root unauthorized.tsx (401 error)
2. Create dashboard unauthorized.tsx (401 error)
3. Create root forbidden.tsx (403 error)
4. Create admin forbidden.tsx (403 error)

## Blockers
None currently.

## Cross-Agent Coordination
- Building on previous Next.js conventions work
- Following TypeScript patterns from recent fixes
