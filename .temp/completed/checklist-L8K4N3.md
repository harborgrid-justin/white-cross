# Implementation Checklist - Next.js Link Updates (L8K4N3)

## Analysis Phase
- [x] Scan for all Link imports (found 107 files)
- [x] Search for `to` prop usage (found 3 instances)
- [x] Search for `passHref` prop (found 0 instances)
- [x] Search for nested `<a>` elements (found 0 instances)
- [x] Identify files requiring updates

## Implementation Phase
- [x] Fix Navigation.tsx line 115: Change `to` to `href`
- [x] Fix Navigation.tsx line 129: Change `to` to `href`
- [x] Fix Navigation.tsx line 336: Change `to` to `href`
- [x] Verify updated file compiles without errors

## Validation Phase
- [x] Verify TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Check that all Link components use proper props
- [x] Document changes in completion summary
- [x] Update all tracking documents

## Next.js 15 Best Practices Applied
- [x] Remove `<a>` child elements (none found - already compliant)
- [x] Remove `passHref` prop (none found - already compliant)
- [x] Ensure `href` prop is used (fixed 3 instances, verified 107 files)
- [x] Proper TypeScript typing maintained
- [x] Prefetch behavior appropriate (default is fine)
- [x] No `replace` prop needed (history should be maintained)
- [x] Scroll behavior default is correct
