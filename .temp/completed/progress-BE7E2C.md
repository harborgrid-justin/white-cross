# End-to-End Message Encryption - Progress Report

**Task ID**: message-encryption-e2e-BE7E2C
**Agent**: backend-encryption-architect
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29T21:10:00Z

## Current Phase
COMPLETED - All phases finished successfully

## Completed Work
- Created task tracking structure and comprehensive planning documents
- Generated implementation plan with security considerations
- Created comprehensive checklist with all requirements
- Analyzed existing codebase structure (message models, cache service, communication DTOs)
- Identified integration points with cache service

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Created `/home/user/white-cross/backend/src/infrastructure/encryption/` directory structure
- Implemented `encryption.service.ts` with AES-256-GCM encryption
- Implemented `key-management.service.ts` with RSA-4096 key generation
- Created `encryption.module.ts` for NestJS dependency injection
- Created comprehensive exports in `index.ts`

### Phase 2: Interfaces and Type Safety
- Created `interfaces/encryption.interfaces.ts` with full type safety
- Created `interfaces/key-management.interfaces.ts` with comprehensive types
- Added discriminated unions for type-safe error handling
- Implemented branded types for different key types
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation

### Phase 3: DTOs
- Created `dto/encrypted-message.dto.ts` with validation
- Created `dto/key-exchange.dto.ts` for key operations
- Created `dto/encryption-keys.dto.ts` for session key management
- Added Swagger/OpenAPI decorators for API documentation
- Implemented class-validator decorations

### Phase 4: Security Implementation
- Used Node.js crypto module exclusively (no external dependencies)
- Implemented PBKDF2 for secure key derivation
- Added constant-time operations where applicable
- Implemented secure random generation for IVs and keys
- Added authentication tags for GCM mode
- Ensured no key material or decrypted content in logs
- Implemented graceful error handling without information leakage

### Phase 5: Redis Integration
- Integrated with existing CacheService
- Implemented session key caching with TTL
- Added key rotation mechanisms
- Implemented key expiration handling
- Used namespaced cache keys for organization

## Current Status
COMPLETED - All implementation phases finished. Ready for integration testing.

## Cross-Agent Coordination
- Successfully referenced existing Redis/cache infrastructure from `/home/user/white-cross/backend/src/infrastructure/cache/cache.service.ts`
- Built on established NestJS module pattern
- Aligned with existing DTO patterns in communication module
- Ready for integration with message service

## Security Implementation Notes
- Node.js crypto module used exclusively
- Private keys encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
- No key material logged anywhere in the code
- Fail-safe error handling implemented
- Backward compatibility with non-encrypted messages supported
- RSA-OAEP used for asymmetric operations
- AES-256-GCM used for symmetric operations (authenticated encryption)
- Unique IV generated per message
- Session keys cached with configurable TTL

## Blockers
None - All work completed successfully
