# Dynamic Rendering Configuration Standardization Plan

**Agent ID**: typescript-architect
**Task ID**: DY3R8N
**Started**: 2025-10-31

## References to Other Agent Work
- Architecture notes: Various agent IDs (E2E9C7, M7B2K9, MG5X2Y, etc.)
- Previous performance work that may have touched dynamic exports

## Objective
Standardize all `export const dynamic` declarations to use single quotes and ensure appropriate routes have dynamic rendering enabled.

## Current State Analysis
- **122 files** with `export const dynamic` declarations found
- **Quote inconsistency**: Majority use double quotes `"force-dynamic"`, only 11 use single quotes `'force-dynamic'`
- **Files to standardize**: ~111 files need quote conversion
- **Priority areas**: (dashboard) and (auth) route groups

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Standardization (Primary Focus)
Convert all double-quoted dynamic exports to single quotes in:
1. **(auth)** route group - access control pages
2. **(dashboard)** route group - user-facing features
   - Dashboard main page
   - Appointments (calendar, lists, real-time updates)
   - Communications (messages, notifications)
   - Incidents (all pages - real-time critical)
   - Medications (administration tracking)
   - Inventory (stock tracking)
   - Analytics (real-time metrics)
   - Compliance
   - Documents
   - Forms

### Phase 2: Verification & Gap Analysis
1. Identify routes that should be dynamic but lack the export:
   - Profile pages
   - Settings pages
   - Real-time monitoring dashboards
   - User-specific content pages
2. Add dynamic exports where needed

### Phase 3: Documentation
Add inline comments for routes that intentionally remain static (if any)

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 30-45 minutes (bulk edits)
- Phase 2: 15-20 minutes (analysis and additions)
- Phase 3: 10 minutes (documentation)
- **Total**: ~60-75 minutes

## Success Criteria
- All `export const dynamic` use single quotes
- All user-specific/real-time routes have `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- Static routes documented with rationale
- Type safety maintained
- No breaking changes
