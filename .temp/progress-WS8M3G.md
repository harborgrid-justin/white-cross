## Quality Metrics

### Type Safety
- ✓ Zero `any` types used
- ✓ Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- ✓ Strict TypeScript validation
- ✓ Type-safe DTO validation methods

### Code Quality
- ✓ SOLID principles applied
- ✓ Consistent error handling
- ✓ Defensive programming
- ✓ Clear separation of concerns

### Performance
- ✓ O(1) rate limit lookups
- ✓ O(1) presence tracking
- ✓ Efficient room broadcasting
- ✓ Automatic cleanup of stale data

## Decisions Made

1. **Token Bucket Algorithm** - Provides burst handling with sustained rate limits
2. **In-Memory Presence** - Fast access, suitable for single-server deployment
3. **Class-Based DTOs** - Consistent with existing pattern, provides validation
4. **Room-Based Isolation** - Leverages Socket.io rooms for efficient broadcasting
5. **WsJwtAuthGuard** - Consistent authentication across all handlers

---

## Coordination Notes

- ✓ Referenced TypeScript quality standards from TS9A4F agent
- ✓ Aligned with existing code patterns
- ✓ No conflicts with other agents
- ✓ Successfully built on existing infrastructure

## Next Steps for Integration

1. Add conversation membership validation (database integration)
2. Implement message persistence layer
3. Add horizontal scaling with Redis adapter
4. Create integration tests
5. Add monitoring metrics
6. Document API for frontend consumption
