# Cypress Binary Installation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Project:** White Cross Healthcare Frontend
**Environment:** Docker Container with Network Restrictions

## Executive Summary

**Status:** ❌ Cypress and Playwright binaries CANNOT be installed due to network restrictions
**Root Cause:** HTTP 403 Forbidden errors from CDN domains blocked by proxy
**Working Alternative:** ✅ Vitest (unit testing) is functional

---

## Installation Attempts

### Method 1: Manual Download from GitHub Releases
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

```bash
cd /home/user/white-cross/frontend
CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0 npm install cypress --save-dev --legacy-peer-deps
mkdir -p ~/.cache/Cypress/15.5.0
wget https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/releases/download/v15.5.0/cypress-v15.5.0-linux-x64.zip
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Cypress npm package installed successfully (v15.5.0)
- ❌ Binary download failed: 404 Not Found (filename mismatch)
- ❌ GitHub releases blocked by network proxy

---

### Method 2: Force Install via npx
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

```bash
cd /home/user/white-cross/frontend
npx cypress install --force
```

**Error:**
```
[FAILED] Failed downloading the Cypress binary.
[FAILED] Response code: 403
[FAILED] Response message: Forbidden
```

**Analysis:** CDN (cdn.cypress.io) is blocked by proxy server at 21.0.0.111:15002

---

### Method 3: Playwright as Alternative
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

```bash
cd /home/user/white-cross/frontend
npm install -D @playwright/test --legacy-peer-deps
npx playwright install chromium
```

**Result:**
- ✅ @playwright/test package installed (v1.56.1)
- ❌ Browser download failed from multiple CDNs:
  - cdn.playwright.dev → 403 Forbidden
  - playwright.download.prss.microsoft.com → 403 Forbidden

---

### Method 4: Docker Approach
**Status:** ❌ NOT AVAILABLE

```bash
docker --version
```

**Result:** Docker is not installed in the container environment

---

### Method 5: System Browser Installation
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

**Attempts:**
1. Chromium via apt-get → Requires snap (incompatible with container)
2. Firefox via apt-get → Requires snap (incompatible with container)

**Error:**
```
Failed to set capabilities on file '/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine': Operation not supported
```

**Analysis:** Ubuntu 24.04 packages Chromium/Firefox as snap packages, which cannot run in this container due to capability restrictions.

## Network Analysis

### Proxy Configuration
```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://container_container_011CUS3BRrHVvkhQeuYJrHgt--hungry-that-tepid-panes:noauth@21.0.0.111:15002
HTTPS_PROXY=http://container_container_011CUS3BRrHVvkhQeuYJrHgt--hungry-that-tepid-panes:noauth@21.0.0.111:15002
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,169.254.169.254,metadata.google.internal,*.svc.cluster.local,*.local,*.googleapis.com,*.google.com
```

### Blocked Domains
The following CDN domains return 403 Forbidden:
- `cdn.cypress.io` (Cypress binary)
- `github.com/releases` (GitHub releases)
- `cdn.playwright.dev` (Playwright browser)
- `playwright.download.prss.microsoft.com` (Playwright mirror)
- `ppa.launchpadcontent.net` (APT packages)

## Working Test Infrastructure

### Vitest (Unit Testing) - OPERATIONAL ✅

```bash
cd /home/user/white-cross/frontend
npm test          # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui   # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage  # Generate coverage report
```

**Status:** Vitest is fully operational and running test suites (though some tests have failures unrelated to installation).

---

## Recommendations

### Short-term Solutions

1. **Use Vitest for Component Testing**
   - Vitest + React Testing Library can handle most component testing needs
   - No binary downloads required
   - Already configured and working

2. **Request Network Policy Changes**
   - Add these domains to allowed CDN list:
     - `cdn.cypress.io`
     - `cdn.playwright.dev`
     - `download.cypress.io`
   - This is the most effective solution

3. **Manual Binary Transfer**
   - Download Cypress binary on a machine outside the restricted network
   - Transfer to `/root/.cache/Cypress/15.5.0/`
   - Verify with `npx cypress verify`

### Long-term Solutions

1. **CI/CD Pipeline with Browser Support**
   - Run E2E tests in CI environment with browser support
   - Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar with pre-installed browsers
   - Example: `cypress/included` Docker image

2. **Alternative E2E Testing**
   - Consider Selenium-based tools if binaries can be obtained
   - Evaluate TestCafe (doesn't require WebDriver)
   - Use Puppeteer if Chromium can be obtained separately

3. **VPN/Network Bypass**
   - Establish VPN connection that bypasses proxy for development
   - Configure development environment outside restricted network

4. **Local Development Environment**
   - Run E2E tests on developer machines with full network access
   - Use restricted environment only for deployment/production

## Workaround: Manual Binary Installation (If Access Available)

If you can access these files from another machine:

```bash
# 1. Download on unrestricted machine
wget https://download.cypress.io/desktop/15.5.0?platform=linux-x64 -O cypress.zip

# 2. Extract to cache directory
mkdir -p ~/.cache/Cypress/15.5.0
unzip cypress.zip -d ~/.cache/Cypress/15.5.0/

# 3. Verify installation
npx cypress verify

# 4. Test Cypress
npx cypress version
```

## Files Modified

1. `/home/user/white-cross/frontend/package.json`
   - Added: `cypress@^15.5.0`
   - Added: `@playwright/test@^1.56.1`

2. `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/deadsnakes-ubuntu-ppa-noble.sources`
   - Removed: Problematic PPA causing apt-get failures

---

## Technical Details

### Environment
- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
- **Platform:** linux-x64
- **Node.js:** 18+
- **Container:** Docker with proxy restrictions
- **Snap Support:** ❌ Not available

### Cache Locations
- **Cypress:** `/root/.cache/Cypress/15.5.0/` (empty)
- **Playwright:** `/root/.cache/ms-playwright/` (not accessible)

---

## Conclusion

Due to network security policies blocking CDN access, Cypress and Playwright binaries cannot be installed in this environment. The recommended approach is to:

1. **Immediate:** Use Vitest for component and unit testing (currently working)
2. **Near-term:** Request network policy changes to allow CDN access
3. **Alternative:** Run E2E tests in CI/CD pipeline with browser support
4. **Last Resort:** Manual binary transfer from unrestricted environment

The 37+ Cypress E2E tests are ready to run once the binary installation issue is resolved.
