/**
 * @fileoverview Witness Statement Database Model
 * @module database/models/incidents/WitnessStatement
 * @description Sequelize model for managing witness statements and testimonies for incident reports.
 * Provides structured collection, verification, and retention of witness accounts for legal compliance.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Witness identification and contact information
 * - Witness type classification (student, staff, parent, other)
 * - Detailed statement documentation
 * - Verification workflow with timestamps
 * - Integration with incident reports
 *
 * Business Rules:
 * - Statements must be 20-3000 characters for proper documentation
 * - Staff witnesses should be identified first (within 1 hour of incident)
 * - Student witness statements should be collected within same school day
 * - Parent/external witness statements collected as soon as practical
 * - All statements require verification by authorized staff
 * - Verified statements cannot be modified (new version required)
 *
 * Legal Requirements:
 * - Witness statements are critical legal evidence
 * - Must be contemporaneous (collected as close to incident as possible)
 * - Required for serious incidents and insurance claims
 * - Used in legal proceedings and compliance investigations
 * - Student witness statements may require parental consent depending on state law
 *
 * @compliance FERPA - Student witness statements are educational records
 * @compliance State regulations - Required for serious incident documentation
 *
 * @legal Retention requirement: 7 years (tied to parent incident report)
 * @legal Admissible as evidence in legal proceedings
 * @legal Must maintain chain of custody and verification
 *

 * @interface WitnessStatementAttributes
 * @description Defines the complete structure of a witness statement record
 *
 * @property {string} id - Unique identifier (UUID v4)
 * @property {string} incidentReportId - Reference to parent incident report
 * @legal Links testimony to specific incident for legal proceedings
 *
 * @property {string} witnessName - Full name of the witness (2-100 characters)
 * @business Required for identification and potential follow-up
 * @legal Critical for legal proceedings and verification
 *
 * @property {WitnessType} witnessType - Type/role of the witness
 * @enum {WitnessType} ['STUDENT', 'STAFF', 'PARENT', 'OTHER']
 * @business STUDENT: Fellow students who observed the incident
 * @business STAFF: School employees (teachers, nurses, administrators)
 * @business PARENT: Parents or guardians present during incident
 * @business OTHER: External witnesses (visitors, contractors, emergency responders)
 * @legal Type affects legal weight and required consent procedures
 *
 * @property {string} [witnessContact] - Contact information (phone or email)
 * @business Optional but recommended for follow-up questions
 * @legal May be required for legal proceedings
 *
 * @property {string} statement - The witness's account of the incident (20-3000 characters)
 * @business Must be detailed enough to be useful for investigation
 * @legal Should be in witness's own words when possible
 * @legal Statement length requirements ensure adequate detail for legal purposes
 *
 * @property {boolean} verified - Whether statement has been verified
 * @business Default: false, must be verified by authorized staff
 * @business Verification confirms identity and reviews statement for completeness
 * @legal Verified statements carry more legal weight
 *
 * @property {string} [verifiedBy] - User ID of staff who verified the statement
 * @business Required when verified = true
 * @compliance Provides accountability and audit trail
 * @legal Establishes chain of custody for legal purposes
 *
 * @property {Date} [verifiedAt] - Timestamp when statement was verified
 * @business Auto-set when verified changes to true
 * @legal Establishes timeline for legal proceedings
 *
 * @property {Date} createdAt - Record creation timestamp
 * @legal Establishes when statement was collected (proximity to incident)

/**
 * @class WitnessStatement
 * @extends Model
 * @description Sequelize model class for witness statements
 *
 * Workflow Summary:
 * 1. Incident occurs â†’ Witnesses identified
 * 2. Statements collected as soon as practical after incident
 * 3. Statement entered into system (verified = false by default)
 * 4. Authorized staff reviews statement for completeness
 * 5. Staff verifies statement (verified = true, auto-timestamps applied)
 * 6. Verified statement becomes part of official incident record
 * 7. Retained for 7 years with incident report
 *
 * Collection Timelines:
 * - STAFF witnesses: Within 1 hour of incident (while details fresh)
 * - STUDENT witnesses: Within same school day (before going home)
 * - PARENT witnesses: Within 24 hours if present
 * - OTHER witnesses: As soon as practical (may require follow-up)
 *
 * Legal Considerations:
 * - Statements should be contemporaneous (close to incident time)
 * - Student statements may require parental consent (check state law)
 * - Statements are admissible in legal proceedings
 * - Chain of custody maintained through verification process
 * - Cannot modify verified statements (create new version if needed)
 *
 * Associations:
 * - belongsTo: IncidentReport (parent incident)
 * - belongsTo: User (verifiedBy - verifying staff member)
 *
 * Hooks:
 * - beforeUpdate: Auto-timestamp verifiedAt when verified = true
 *
 * @example
 * // Create a witness statement
 * const statement = await WitnessStatement.create({
 *   incidentReportId: 'incident-uuid',
 *   witnessName: 'John Smith',
 *   witnessType: WitnessType.STAFF,
 *   witnessContact: 'jsmith@school.edu',
 *   statement: 'I was supervising the playground when I saw the student...'
 * });
 *
 * @example
 * // Verify a statement
 * await statement.update({
 *   verified: true,
 *   verifiedBy: 'admin-uuid'
 * });
 * // verifiedAt is automatically set
