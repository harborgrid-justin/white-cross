/**
 * @fileoverview Health Records Controller - Comprehensive health record and medical history management.
 *
 * This controller provides HTTP request handling for all health record operations in the
 * White Cross healthcare platform, including:
 * - General health records (diagnoses, treatments, medical visits)
 * - Allergy management with severity tracking
 * - Chronic condition monitoring and care plans
 * - Immunization/vaccination records with compliance tracking
 * - Vital signs and growth measurements
 * - Medical summaries and compliance reports
 *
 * Clinical Context:
 * - Maintains complete student medical history per FERPA/HIPAA requirements
 * - Supports ICD-10 diagnostic coding for conditions
 * - Tracks immunization compliance against state/CDC schedules
 * - Records allergy severity levels (MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, LIFE_THREATENING)
 * - Monitors vital signs with age-appropriate ranges
 * - Generates comprehensive medical summaries for emergency reference
 *
 * Database Alignment:
 * All controllers map to health_records schema with proper field names:
 * - recordType: Type of health record (ENUM from HealthRecordType) (REQUIRED)
 * - recordDate: Date when health event occurred (REQUIRED)
 * - diagnosis: Medical diagnosis description (optional, ICD-10 code recommended)
 * - treatment: Treatment provided or recommended (optional)
 * - notes: Additional clinical notes or comments (optional)
 * - provider: Healthcare provider name (optional)
