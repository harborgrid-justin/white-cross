2. **2 Medication service files** with duplicated functionality
3. **1 Frontend API file** with `.enhanced` suffix
4. Potential confusion in naming conventions

---

## 1. Backend Files Requiring Action

### 1.1 Health Record Service Files

#### Current State (4 files - CONSOLIDATE TO 1):
```
F:\temp\white-cross\backend\src\services\healthRecordService.ts (951 lines)
F:\temp\white-cross\backend\src\services\healthRecordService.enhanced.ts (1,468 lines)
F:\temp\white-cross\backend\src\services\healthRecordService.part2.ts (1,574 lines)
F:\temp\white-cross\backend\src\services\healthRecordService.optimized.ts (745 lines)
```

#### Analysis:
- **healthRecordService.ts** - Base implementation with standard CRUD operations
- **healthRecordService.enhanced.ts** - Extended version with PHI logging, enhanced error handling, and additional features
- **healthRecordService.part2.ts** - Contains Vaccination, Screening, Growth, and Vital Signs services
- **healthRecordService.optimized.ts** - Performance-optimized version with Redis caching

#### Recommendation:
**Option A: Single Unified File (RECOMMENDED)**
```
Merge into: healthRecordService.ts
- Keep base CRUD from original
- Integrate PHI logging from .enhanced
- Incorporate optimization features from .optimized
- Move sub-services to separate files:
  - vaccinationService.ts
  - screeningService.ts
  - growthMeasurementService.ts
  - vitalSignsService.ts
```

**Option B: Keep Separate for Gradual Migration**
```
Rename files clearly:
- healthRecordService.ts → healthRecordService.legacy.ts
- healthRecordService.enhanced.ts → healthRecordService.ts (main)
- Delete: healthRecordService.part2.ts (move to separate files)
- Delete: healthRecordService.optimized.ts (merge optimizations into main)
```

### 1.2 Medication Service Files

#### Current State (2 files - CONSOLIDATE TO 1):
```
F:\temp\white-cross\backend\src\services\medicationService.ts
F:\temp\white-cross\backend\src\services\medicationService.optimized.ts
```

#### Analysis:
- Both files contain similar functionality
- `.optimized.ts` version includes Redis caching, full-text search, and performance improvements
- Main difference: optimized version has materialized views and frequency parsing cache

#### Recommendation:
```
Action: Merge into medicationService.ts
1. Keep medicationService.ts as the base
2. Integrate all optimizations from medicationService.optimized.ts:
   - Redis caching layer
   - Full-text search
   - Materialized views for inventory alerts
   - Frequency parsing memoization
3. Delete medicationService.optimized.ts after merge
4. Update all imports to point to medicationService.ts
```

### 1.3 Other Backend Files

#### File: resilientMedicationService.ts
```
Status: KEEP - Separate concern (circuit breaker pattern)
Location: F:\temp\white-cross\backend\src\services\resilientMedicationService.ts
Reason: Implements resilience patterns, distinct from core service
```

---

## 2. Frontend Files Requiring Action

### 2.1 Health Records API Files

#### Current State (2 files - CONSOLIDATE TO 1):
```
F:\temp\white-cross\frontend\src\services\modules\healthRecordsApi.ts (2,086+ lines)
F:\temp\white-cross\frontend\src\services\modules\healthRecordsApi.enhanced.ts (1,063 lines)
```

#### Analysis:
- **healthRecordsApi.ts** - Comprehensive API client with all operations
- **healthRecordsApi.enhanced.ts** - Service-oriented architecture (SOA) version with enhanced error handling

#### Recommendation:
```
Action: Merge into healthRecordsApi.ts
1. Keep healthRecordsApi.ts as the main file (more complete)
2. Integrate improvements from .enhanced version:
   - Enhanced Zod validation schemas
   - Better error classes (HealthRecordsApiError, ValidationError, etc.)
   - Improved error handling in handleApiError function
3. Delete healthRecordsApi.enhanced.ts
4. Update all component imports
```

---

## 3. Naming Convention Standards

### Backend (Established Standards):
```typescript
Services:      camelCase  (e.g., healthRecordService.ts ✓)
Routes:        camelCase  (e.g., healthRecords.ts ✓)
Controllers:   camelCase  (e.g., healthRecordController.ts)
Middleware:    camelCase  (e.g., auth.ts ✓, errorHandler.ts ✓)
Utilities:     camelCase  (e.g., logger.ts ✓)
```

### Frontend (Established Standards):
```typescript
Components:    PascalCase (e.g., HealthRecords.tsx ✓, AllergiesTab.tsx ✓)
Hooks:         camelCase  (e.g., useHealthRecords.ts ✓)
Services/APIs: camelCase  (e.g., healthRecordsApi.ts ✓)
Pages:         PascalCase (e.g., Dashboard.tsx ✓)
Utils:         camelCase  (e.g., apiUtils.ts ✓)
```

### ✓ Current Compliance:
Most files already follow these conventions. The issues are primarily with temporary/versioned files (.enhanced, .optimized, .part2).

## 4. Detailed Action Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Health Record Service Consolidation

**Step 1: Create separate service files for sub-modules**
```bash
# Create new files
touch backend/src/services/vaccinationService.ts
touch backend/src/services/screeningService.ts
touch backend/src/services/growthMeasurementService.ts
touch backend/src/services/vitalSignsService.ts

# Extract classes from healthRecordService.part2.ts:
# - VaccinationService → vaccinationService.ts
# - ScreeningService → screeningService.ts
# - GrowthMeasurementService → growthMeasurementService.ts
# - VitalSignsService → vitalSignsService.ts
```

**Step 2: Merge functionality into healthRecordService.ts**
```typescript
// Merge in this order:
1. Base types and interfaces from all versions
2. Core CRUD operations from healthRecordService.ts
3. PHI logging and audit features from .enhanced
4. Caching and optimization from .optimized
5. Allergy and chronic condition management
6. Export/import functionality
```

**Step 3: Delete obsolete files**
```bash
rm backend/src/services/healthRecordService.enhanced.ts
rm backend/src/services/healthRecordService.part2.ts
rm backend/src/services/healthRecordService.optimized.ts
```

**Step 4: Update imports**
```typescript
// Search for imports in:
- backend/src/routes/*.ts
- backend/src/controllers/*.ts
- backend/tests/**/*.test.ts

// Update from:
import { EnhancedHealthRecordService } from '../services/healthRecordService.enhanced';
import { OptimizedHealthRecordService } from '../services/healthRecordService.optimized';

// To:
import { HealthRecordService } from '../services/healthRecordService';
import { VaccinationService } from '../services/vaccinationService';
// etc.
```

### Phase 2: Backend Medication Service Consolidation

**Step 1: Merge medicationService.optimized.ts into medicationService.ts**
```typescript
// Add to medicationService.ts:
1. Redis caching constants and functions
2. Frequency parsing cache (in-memory Map)
3. Full-text search implementation
4. Materialized views for inventory
5. Initialize frequency cache on module load
```

**Step 2: Delete obsolete file**
```bash
rm backend/src/services/medicationService.optimized.ts
```

**Step 3: Update imports**
```typescript
// Update from:
import { MedicationServiceOptimized } from '../services/medicationService.optimized';

// To:
import { MedicationService } from '../services/medicationService';
```

### Phase 3: Frontend Health Records API Consolidation

**Step 1: Merge healthRecordsApi.enhanced.ts into healthRecordsApi.ts**
```typescript
// Enhance healthRecordsApi.ts with:
1. Custom error classes (HealthRecordsApiError, ValidationError, etc.)
2. Improved handleApiError function
3. Enhanced Zod validation schemas
4. Better type definitions
```

**Step 2: Delete obsolete file**
```bash
rm frontend/src/services/modules/healthRecordsApi.enhanced.ts
```

**Step 3: Update imports**
```typescript
// Search in:
- frontend/src/pages/**/*.tsx
- frontend/src/components/**/*.tsx
- frontend/src/hooks/**/*.ts

// Update from:
import { healthRecordsApiService } from '@/services/modules/healthRecordsApi.enhanced';

// To:
import { healthRecordsApi } from '@/services/modules/healthRecordsApi';
```

- Duplicated functionality across multiple files
- Potential for import confusion

**Recommended Approach:** Consolidate all variations into the base files, extracting sub-services where appropriate. This will:
- Reduce code duplication
- Improve maintainability
- Clarify the service architecture
- Align with established naming conventions

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Requires careful testing but follows safe patterns.

**Timeline:** 2-3 days for complete implementation and testing.
