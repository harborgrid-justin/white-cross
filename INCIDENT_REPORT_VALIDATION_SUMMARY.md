- **Description**: Minimum 20 characters (50 for medication errors) for proper documentation
- **Location**: Required, minimum 3 characters for safety documentation
- **Actions Taken**: Required, minimum 10 characters - must document response to all incidents
- **Occurred At**: Must not be in the future
- **Injury Incidents**: Automatically require follow-up
- **Medication Errors**: Require detailed description (50+ characters minimum)
- **High/Critical Severity**: Warning logged if parent notification not acknowledged

#### Witness Statement Validation
- **Witness Name**: Minimum 2 characters, maximum 100 characters
- **Statement**: Minimum 20 characters for credible documentation
- **Verification**: Verified statements must have verifier and timestamp

#### Follow-Up Action Validation
- **Action Description**: Minimum 5 characters, maximum 500 characters
- **Due Date**: Must be in the future for new actions
- **Priority**: Required field with URGENT priority warning for >24 hour due dates

## Validation Error Messages

All validation errors include:
1. **Clear description** of what's wrong
2. **Specific requirements** (e.g., "minimum 20 characters")
3. **Context** explaining why (e.g., "for proper documentation")
4. **Actionable guidance** for fixing the issue

Example:
```
❌ "Description is required"
✅ "Description must be at least 20 characters for proper documentation"
```

---

## Status Workflow Validation

### Follow-Up Actions
- PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED (or CANCELLED)
- COMPLETED requires: completedBy, completedAt, notes (warned)
- Status changes auto-manage timestamps

### Incident Reports
- Parent notification tracking with timestamps
- Follow-up completion tracking
- Insurance claim status progression
- Compliance status tracking

### Witness Statements
- Unverified → Verified transition
- Verification requires: verifiedBy, verifiedAt
- Cannot unverify once verified (business rule)

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Backend Testing
1. Test all validation rules with invalid data
2. Test business logic (auto-follow-up, auto-notify)
3. Test model hooks (timestamp auto-population)
4. Test status workflow transitions
5. Test minimum/maximum length constraints

### Frontend Testing
1. Test form validation with React Hook Form + Zod
2. Test business rule warnings (URGENT >24hrs, etc.)
3. Test type-based validation (medication errors)
4. Test completion requirements (notes for COMPLETED)

### Integration Testing
1. Test create → update → read flow
2. Test parent notification flow
3. Test follow-up action lifecycle
4. Test witness statement verification
5. Test evidence attachment

## Migration Considerations

### Database Schema
- No database migrations needed (validations are application-level)
- Consider adding CHECK constraints for critical validations
- Consider adding triggers for audit logging

### Existing Data
- Existing records may not meet new validation requirements
- Consider data migration script to fix non-compliant records
- Add validation warnings for legacy data

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. Multi-language validation messages
2. Configurable validation rules per district/school
3. Advanced business rules engine
4. AI-powered incident description suggestions
5. Automatic severity classification based on keywords

### Performance Optimizations
