2. Run health checks on green
3. Route 10% traffic to green (canary)
4. Monitor for 5 minutes
5. If successful, route 100% to green
6. Keep blue running for 24h quick rollback

**Benefits**:
- No user-facing downtime
- Easy rollback (switch back to blue)
- Production testing before full cutover
- Maintains HIPAA availability requirements

### Automated Testing

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Backend: 80% minimum
- Frontend: 80% minimum
- E2E: Critical user flows

**Test Types**:
