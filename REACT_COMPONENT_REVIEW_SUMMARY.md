## What Was Fixed

### ✅ HealthRecordModal.tsx - Critical Bug Fix

**Problem**: When editing an existing health record, the form wasn't updating with the record data. The `initialData` prop changes weren't being watched, causing stale data to display.

**Fix Applied**: Added a `useEffect` hook to sync form data when `initialData` changes.

**File**: `frontend/src/components/features/health-records/components/modals/HealthRecordModal.tsx`

**Impact**: Form now correctly displays data in edit mode and resets in create mode.
