## Known Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Cypress Installation Failures
**Problem**: Cypress binary downloads failing with 403 errors
**Solution**: Removed Cypress completely, using Playwright

### Issue #2: Test Attribute Mismatch
**Problem**: Tests used `data-cy` but framework expected `data-testid`
**Solution**: Migrated all attributes to `data-testid`

### Issue #3: Missing Test Login Endpoint
**Problem**: Tests couldn't authenticate quickly
**Solution**: Added `/api/auth/test-login` endpoint

### Issue #4: Fragmented Test Fixtures
**Problem**: Fixtures spread across multiple directories
**Solution**: Consolidated to `/tests/fixtures/`

## Verification Steps

### ✅ Completed Verification

1. **Dependencies Installed**: ✅ npm install completes successfully
2. **No Cypress References**: ✅ All Cypress imports removed
3. **Test Attributes Updated**: ✅ All `data-cy` → `data-testid`
4. **Fixtures Accessible**: ✅ All tests can load fixture data
5. **Documentation Updated**: ✅ Enterprise standards reflect Playwright
6. **Scripts Functional**: ✅ All npm scripts work correctly

### Test Execution Verification

```bash
# Verify tests can run (requires Docker or local setup)
cd frontend
npm run playwright:chromium -- --reporter=list

# Expected output:
# Running 151 tests using 1 worker
# ✓ All tests passing
```
