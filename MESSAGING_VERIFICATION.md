## 9. Known Limitations

### 9.1 Current Limitations

1. **Message Templates**
   - Status: Not yet implemented
   - Impact: Users cannot use pre-defined templates for common messages
   - Workaround: Users must manually type each message
   - Planned: Q1 2026

2. **Voice Call Delivery**
   - Status: Not yet implemented
   - Impact: Emergency alerts cannot be delivered via voice call
   - Workaround: Use SMS and push notifications for urgent alerts
   - Planned: Q2 2026

3. **Message Search**
   - Status: Limited implementation
   - Impact: Users can only filter messages by basic criteria
   - Workaround: Use pagination and manual browsing
   - Planned: Full-text search in Q1 2026

4. **Attachment Support**
   - Status: URL-based only
   - Impact: Users cannot upload files directly
   - Workaround: Upload files to secure storage first, then include URL
   - Planned: Direct file upload in Q2 2026

5. **Encryption**
   - Status: Not fully implemented
   - Impact: Messages not encrypted end-to-end
   - Workaround: Use HTTPS for transport encryption only
   - Planned: E2E encryption in Q1 2026

### 9.2 Performance Limitations

1. **WebSocket Connections**
   - Current Capacity: ~1,000 concurrent connections per instance
   - Recommendation: Scale horizontally for larger deployments
   - Monitoring: Track connection count and CPU/memory usage

2. **Bulk Messaging**
   - Current Capacity: ~100 recipients per message
   - Limitation: Larger recipient lists may timeout
   - Recommendation: Batch messages in groups of 100

3. **Message History**
   - Current Retention: All messages stored indefinitely
   - Limitation: Database growth over time
   - Recommendation: Implement data retention policy

### Recommendation

The messaging platform is **NOT YET READY** for production deployment. The following critical items must be completed:

**CRITICAL (Must Have for Production):**
1. Implement end-to-end encryption for PHI data
2. Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
3. Complete load testing and performance optimization
4. Implement message queue with Redis/Bull
5. Add real-time typing indicators and read receipts
6. Set up proper error handling and circuit breakers

**HIGH PRIORITY (Should Have Soon):**
1. Implement message templates
2. Add full-text message search
3. Complete HIPAA compliance audit
4. Set up automated backups and disaster recovery
5. Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have):**
1. Voice call delivery channel
2. Rich text formatting
3. Message archiving
4. Advanced analytics dashboard

### Estimated Timeline to Production Ready

- **2-3 weeks**: Complete critical items
- **4-6 weeks**: Complete high priority items
- **Target production date**: December 15, 2025 (6 weeks from now)
