```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Create Appointment with Automatic Reminders

```typescript
const appointment = await appointmentsApi.create({
  studentId: 'student_123',
  nurseId: 'nurse_456',
  type: 'ROUTINE_CHECKUP',
  scheduledAt: '2024-01-15T09:00:00Z',
  reason: 'Annual checkup',
  duration: 30
});
// Reminders automatically scheduled at -24h, -2h, -30min
```

### 2. Set Nurse Availability

```typescript
// Recurring availability (every Monday)
await appointmentsApi.setAvailability({
  nurseId: 'nurse_456',
  dayOfWeek: 1, // Monday
  startTime: '08:00',
  endTime: '16:00',
  isRecurring: true
});

// Specific date unavailability
await appointmentsApi.setAvailability({
  nurseId: 'nurse_456',
  specificDate: '2024-01-20',
  startTime: '00:00',
  endTime: '23:59',
  isAvailable: false,
  reason: 'Conference attendance'
});
```

### 3. Add to Waitlist

```typescript
await appointmentsApi.addToWaitlist({
  studentId: 'student_789',
  type: 'FOLLOW_UP',
  reason: 'Post-injury checkup',
  priority: 'HIGH',
  preferredDate: '2024-01-18T10:00:00Z'
});
// Will be automatically scheduled if a matching slot becomes available
```

);
// Download and import into any calendar app
```
