// Form components are currently organized within their respective feature directories:

// - Medication forms: components/features/medications/components/MedicationFormModal.tsx
// - Appointment forms: components/features/appointments/components/AppointmentFormModal.tsx
// - Health records forms: within components/features/health-records/components/modals/

// This index currently serves as documentation of the form architecture.
// Generic/shared form utilities could be added here in the future.
