/**
 * @fileoverview Electronic Signature Page - ESIGN Act and UETA compliant digital signing
 *
 * This page provides a legally binding electronic signature interface for healthcare documents.
 * All signatures are cryptographically signed, timestamped, and logged for complete audit trails.
 * The implementation complies with ESIGN Act, UETA, FDA 21 CFR Part 11, and HIPAA requirements.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - Legally binding electronic signatures with cryptographic validation
 * - Multiple signature types: typed, drawn, uploaded image
 * - Real-time signature preview and validation
 * - Multi-party signature workflows (sequential and parallel)
 * - Signature certificate generation with chain of custody
 * - Tamper-evident sealing of signed documents
 * - Comprehensive audit trail for compliance
 *
 * **E-Signature Implementation:**
 * - Digital signatures use PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
 * - Each signature includes: signer identity, timestamp, IP address, device info
 * - Document hash computed before and after signing to detect tampering
 * - Signatures embedded in document metadata or as overlay layer
 * - Certificate of completion generated automatically
 *
 * **Legal Compliance:**
 * - **ESIGN Act (2000)**: Electronic signatures have same legal standing as handwritten
 * - **UETA**: Uniform Electronic Transactions Act compliance
 * - **FDA 21 CFR Part 11**: Electronic records and signatures for healthcare
 * - **HIPAA**: Audit logging and access controls for PHI documents
 *
 * **Security & Audit Requirements:**
 * - Signer identity verified before signature capture
 * - Document locked after first signature to prevent modifications
 * - All signature events logged: initiation, completion, rejection
 * - Signature certificates stored separately from documents
 * - Multi-factor authentication option for high-risk signatures
 *
 * **Signature Workflow:**
 * 1. User views document requiring signature
 * 2. System verifies user authorization to sign
 * 3. Legal notice displayed with ESIGN Act disclosure
 * 4. User provides signature (typed, drawn, or uploaded)
 * 5. System captures signer metadata (name, timestamp, IP, device)
 * 6. Document hash computed and signature cryptographically signed
 * 7. Signature embedded and document sealed
 * 8. Certificate of completion generated
 * 9. All parties notified of signature completion
 * 10. Audit log entries created

/**
 * Electronic Signature Page Component
 *
 * Server component that renders the e-signature interface with required legal disclosures.
 * This page ensures users understand the legal implications of electronic signatures and
 * provides a secure, compliant signing experience.
 *
 * **Pre-Signature Validation:**
 * - User authentication verified (enforced by middleware)
 * - User authorized to sign this specific document
 * - Document not already signed (or supports multiple signatures)
 * - Document not expired or revoked
 * - User has accepted ESIGN Act disclosure
 *
 * **Signature Types Supported:**
 * 1. **Typed Signature**: User types their full legal name in designated font
 * 2. **Drawn Signature**: User draws signature using mouse/touch on canvas
 * 3. **Uploaded Signature**: User uploads image of handwritten signature
 * 4. **Biometric Signature**: Advanced signature with pressure/velocity data (optional)
 *
 * **Legal Notice Requirements:**
 * - ESIGN Act disclosure must be shown before signature capture
 * - User must explicitly consent to use electronic signatures
 * - Notice explains legal implications and user rights
 * - Disclosure includes method to request paper documents
 *
 * **Signature Validation:**
 * - Signature data must not be empty or trivial (e.g., single dot)
 * - Full legal name required and validated against user profile
 * - IP address and device information captured for audit
 * - Timestamp accurate to milliseconds (NTP synchronized)
 *
 * **Post-Signature Processing:**
 * 1. Signature data encoded and encrypted
 * 2. Document hash computed (SHA-256 or stronger)
 * 3. Digital certificate applied with PKI signature
 * 4. Document sealed to prevent modifications
 * 5. Certificate of completion generated as PDF
 * 6. Email notifications sent to all relevant parties
 * 7. Document moved to "signed" status in workflow
 * 8. Audit log entries created with full chain of custody
 *
 * **Error Handling:**
 * - Invalid document ID: 404 Not Found
 * - User not authorized to sign: 403 Forbidden
 * - Document already fully signed: Redirect to view page
 * - Network error during signature: Signature saved and retried
 * - Validation failure: Clear error message, signature not applied
 *
 * @async
 * @function SignDocumentPage
 * @param {SignDocumentPageProps} props - Page props with document ID
 * @returns {Promise<JSX.Element>} Rendered signature page with legal disclosures
 * @throws {notFound} When document ID is invalid or missing
 *
 * @example
 * // Healthcare provider signs consent form
 * // 1. Navigate to /documents/consent-123/sign
 * // 2. View legal notice and document preview
 * // 3. Draw signature on canvas
 * // 4. Confirm signature submission
 * // 5. System applies cryptographic signature
 * // 6. Certificate generated and emailed
 * // 7. Document marked as signed in system
 *
 * @security
 * - Signature events logged for HIPAA compliance
 * - Cryptographic signing prevents tampering
 * - Multi-factor authentication available for sensitive documents
 * - IP address and device fingerprint recorded
 * - Session timeout enforced during signing process
 *
 * @compliance
 * - ESIGN Act Section 101(c): Electronic signatures are valid
 * - UETA Section 7: Legal recognition of electronic signatures
 * - FDA 21 CFR Part 11.50: Signature manifestations
 * - FDA 21 CFR Part 11.70: Signature/record linking
