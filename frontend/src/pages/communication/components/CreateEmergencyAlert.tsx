/**
 * @component CreateEmergencyAlert
 * Component for creating and sending emergency alerts to parents, staff, and emergency contacts.
 *
 * Emergency alerts are high-priority, immediate notifications sent through multiple channels
 * (SMS, email, push notifications, voice calls) to ensure rapid delivery of critical information
 * such as school lockdowns, medical emergencies, or urgent health-related communications.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Basic usage
 * <CreateEmergencyAlert />
 *
 * // With custom styling
 * <CreateEmergencyAlert className="mt-4" />
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## Emergency Broadcast Workflow
 * - **Immediate Delivery**: Bypasses normal message queuing for instant transmission
 * - **Multi-Channel**: Automatically sends via SMS, email, push, and voice channels
 * - **Priority Routing**: Marked as URGENT priority for recipient notification systems
 * - **Delivery Confirmation**: Tracks delivery status and read receipts across all channels
 * - **Recipient Groups**: Can target parents, emergency contacts, staff, or all groups
 * - **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of who created alert, when sent, and delivery status
 *
 * ## Alert Categories
 * - Medical Emergency (student injury, severe allergic reaction)
 * - Security Alert (lockdown, evacuation)
 * - Weather Emergency (severe weather, early dismissal)
 * - Public Health (disease outbreak, health advisory)
 * - Facility Issue (power outage, water issue)
 *
 * ## Redux Integration
 * - Connected to communication Redux slice for alert state management
 * - Stores draft alerts temporarily in session storage (not localStorage for PHI compliance)
 * - Updates delivery status in real-time via WebSocket connection
 *
 * ## PHI Handling
 * - Alert content may contain student health information
 * - All alerts logged with HIPAA-compliant audit trail
 * - No PHI stored in browser localStorage
 * - Secure transmission via HTTPS and encrypted channels
 *
 * ## Accessibility Features
 * - ARIA labels for screen reader navigation
 * - Keyboard shortcuts for emergency alert sending
 * - High contrast mode support for visibility
 * - Focus management for modal dialogs
 * - Error announcements for screen readers
 *
 * @see {@link EmergencyAlerts} for viewing sent emergency alerts
