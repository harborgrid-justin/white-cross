**Agent ID**: accessibility-architect
**Task ID**: X7Y3Z9
**Start Date**: 2025-10-29
**Related Work**: API Architect (A1B2C3) - API integration review

## Objectives

Conduct comprehensive WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility audit covering semantic HTML, form accessibility, keyboard navigation, ARIA implementation, color contrast, and healthcare-specific accessibility requirements.

## Phase 1: Semantic HTML Review (45 mins)
- Review main page layouts (dashboard, auth, forms)
- Check heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3 progression)
- Audit landmark usage (main, nav, header, footer, aside)
- Identify divs that should be buttons or links
- Check document structure in key pages

## Phase 2: Form Accessibility Audit (60 mins)
- Review login, registration, and data entry forms
- Check label associations (for/id pairing)
- Verify required fields have aria-required
- Review error message patterns and aria-describedby
- Check validation feedback and live announcements
- Audit form components (Input, Select, Checkbox, etc.)

## Phase 3: Keyboard Navigation Testing (45 mins)
- Check tab order in main navigation flows
- Verify focus indicators (outline, ring classes)
- Test modal/dialog keyboard traps and Escape handling
- Check skip navigation links
- Review interactive element keyboard access
- Test dropdown and menu keyboard patterns

## Phase 4: ARIA Implementation Review (60 mins)
- Audit button aria-labels (icon-only buttons)
- Check dialog/modal ARIA patterns
- Review loading states (aria-busy, role="status")
- Check alert patterns (role="alert")
- Verify dynamic content announcements
- Review component ARIA usage (tabs, accordions, etc.)

## Phase 5: Color and Visual Accessibility (30 mins)
- Review status badge color contrast ratios
- Check button and link contrast
- Verify focus indicator contrast (3:1 minimum)
- Review dark mode contrast compliance
- Check if color is sole indicator
- Review text sizing and spacing

## Phase 6: Healthcare-Specific Accessibility (45 mins)
- Review medication administration forms
- Check patient data screen reader announcements
- Verify emergency alert patterns
- Review incident reporting accessibility
- Check health record navigation
- Audit appointment scheduling flows

## Phase 7: Report Generation (45 mins)
- Compile WCAG violations by severity
- Document semantic HTML issues with examples
- List form accessibility problems with fixes
- Identify keyboard navigation gaps
- Provide healthcare accessibility recommendations
- Create prioritized quick-wins list

## Deliverables

1. **WCAG Compliance Report** with 6 sections:
   - WCAG Violations (Critical A, Important AA)
   - Semantic HTML Issues
   - Form Accessibility Problems
   - Keyboard Navigation Issues
   - Healthcare Accessibility Concerns
   - Quick Wins (Top 10 fixes)

2. **Architecture Notes** (architecture-notes-X7Y3Z9.md)
   - Accessibility patterns identified
   - WCAG compliance strategy
   - Component accessibility standards
   - Healthcare-specific patterns

3. **Checklist** (checklist-X7Y3Z9.md)
   - WCAG 2.1 Level A criteria
   - WCAG 2.1 Level AA criteria
   - Healthcare accessibility requirements

## Success Criteria

- All WCAG Level A violations documented
- All WCAG Level AA violations documented
- Semantic HTML issues cataloged with examples
- Form accessibility gaps identified with fixes
- Keyboard navigation problems listed with solutions
- Healthcare-specific issues highlighted
- Prioritized remediation roadmap with quick wins

## Coordination Notes

- API Architect (A1B2C3) is reviewing API integration patterns
- Will reference their findings when reviewing data loading states and error handling accessibility
- Focus management recommendations will consider their server action patterns
