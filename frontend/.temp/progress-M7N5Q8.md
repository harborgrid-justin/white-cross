# Progress Report: Fix TS2305 Module Export Errors - Agent 6

## Agent ID: M7N5Q8
## Status: Completed
## Current Phase: Completion

## Completed
- ✅ Created tracking documents (task-status, plan, checklist, progress)
- ✅ Identified error sources from other agents' work
- ✅ Analyzed all TS2305 errors from error logs
- ✅ Verified type exports (BudgetVariance, DocumentMetadata, RootState, getStorageStats) already exist
- ✅ Verified schema exports already exist
- ✅ Verified action exports (markAsReadAction, deleteBroadcastAction) already exist
- ✅ Added default exports to 7 modal components:
  - AllergyModal.tsx
  - CarePlanModal.tsx
  - ConditionModal.tsx
  - ConfirmationModal.tsx
  - DetailsModal.tsx
  - MeasurementModal.tsx
  - VaccinationModal.tsx
- ✅ Added default exports to 4 UI components:
  - Badge.tsx
  - Checkbox.tsx
  - SearchInput.tsx
  - Switch.tsx

## Summary
Fixed 11 TS2305 module export errors by adding default exports to component files that were being imported as default but only had named exports. All type, schema, and action exports were already present and didn't need modification.

## Next Steps
None - task complete. Files ready for other agents to continue TypeScript error fixes.

## Blockers
None

## Cross-Agent Coordination
- Built on error catalogs from Agent T5E8R2 and K9M3P6
- Fixed component export issues that were blocking imports
- No conflicts with other agents' work
