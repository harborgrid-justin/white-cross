# API Integration Review Plan - White Cross Healthcare Platform

**Agent ID**: api-architect
**Task ID**: A1B2C3
**Start Date**: 2025-10-29

## Objectives

Conduct comprehensive API integration review to identify inconsistencies, missing endpoints, response handling issues, and server action problems across the White Cross Healthcare Platform.

## Phase 1: Endpoint Mapping (30 mins)
- Read api-client.ts to catalog all defined API_ENDPOINTS
- Scan all pages for API calls and endpoint usage
- Identify pages making calls to undefined endpoints
- Map endpoint usage patterns across the application

## Phase 2: API Client Usage Review (30 mins)
- Identify which pages use apiClient vs direct fetch calls
- Review error handling patterns across different pages
- Check loading state management consistency
- Document pages not using apiClient abstraction

## Phase 3: Response Structure Analysis (30 mins)
- Scan pages for response data access patterns
- Identify pages handling {data: [], meta: {}} structure
- Identify pages handling {students: [], pagination: {}} structure
- Find pages vulnerable to response structure changes
- Recommend normalization approach

## Phase 4: Server Actions Review (30 mins)
- Locate all server action files (actions.ts, etc.)
- Check Next.js 15 async API usage (cookies, params)
- Verify auth token handling consistency
- Review error handling patterns
- Document inconsistencies between action files

## Phase 5: Backend Alignment Validation (30 mins)
- Based on navigation and features, list expected API endpoints
- Compare frontend API_ENDPOINTS with backend routes
- Identify missing API integrations
- Flag potentially incorrect endpoint definitions

## Phase 6: Report Generation (30 mins)
- Compile findings into structured report
- Prioritize issues by severity
- Provide code examples and recommendations
- Create API integration roadmap

## Deliverables

1. **API Integration Report** with 5 sections:
   - Missing API Endpoints
   - API Client Inconsistencies
   - Response Handling Issues
   - Server Action Problems
   - API Integration Roadmap

2. **Integration Map** (integration-map-A1B2C3.json)
   - Endpoint inventory with usage status
   - Response schema documentation
   - Integration health assessment

3. **Architecture Notes** (architecture-notes-A1B2C3.md)
   - API design patterns identified
   - Recommended standardization approaches
   - Security and performance considerations

## Success Criteria

- All frontend pages mapped to API endpoints
- Response handling patterns documented
- Server action issues identified
- Prioritized roadmap for API improvements
- Actionable recommendations with code examples
