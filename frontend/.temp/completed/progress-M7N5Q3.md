# Progress Report - TypeScript Hanging Investigation (M7N5Q3)

## Current Phase: ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed Work

✅ **Root Cause Analysis** (Phase 1)
- Identified configuration conflict: `incremental: true` + `noEmit: true`
- Located .tsbuildinfo file (298KB) at project root
- Documented the deadlock mechanism causing the hang
- Created comprehensive architecture notes explaining the issue

✅ **Configuration Fix** (Phase 2)
- Removed stale .tsbuildinfo file (298KB)
- Removed `"incremental": true` from tsconfig.json line 24
- Validated tsconfig.json remains properly formatted

✅ **Validation Testing** (Phase 3)
- Tested fix with multiple runs of `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Confirmed completion in 18.978 seconds (no hanging)
- Verified proper exit codes and error reporting
- Documented performance characteristics

✅ **Documentation** (Phase 4)
- Created comprehensive completion summary
- Documented prevention recommendations
- Updated all tracking files
- Provided verification steps for future

### Final Results

**Before Fix**:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` hung indefinitely
- Required manual kill or timeout workarounds
- Unreliable CI/CD builds
- Poor developer experience

**After Fix**:
- Completes reliably in ~19 seconds
- Proper exit codes and error reporting
- No hanging or deadlock
- Clean CI/CD execution
