# Progress Report - TS2345 Error Fixes (F6G8H2)

## Current Status
**Phase:** Initial Analysis & Setup
**Started:** 2025-11-01T05:41:00Z
**Errors to Fix:** 276

## Completed Work
- Created tracking infrastructure (task-status, plan, checklist, progress)
- Analyzed error patterns and categorized into 9 workstreams
- Identified solution strategies for each category

## Current Work
- About to begin Phase 1: Reading error files and creating utility functions

## Blockers
None currently

## Next Steps
1. Read sample files from each error category
2. Create type utility functions
3. Begin systematic fixes starting with conditional className errors
4. Process through all 9 workstreams

## Decisions Made
- Using unique ID F6G8H2 to avoid conflicts with existing agent work
- Following additive-only approach - no code deletion
- Categorized errors into 9 distinct workstreams for systematic resolution

## Cross-Agent Coordination
- Building on type system work from previous agents
- Respecting architecture decisions in .temp/architecture-notes-A1B2C3.md
