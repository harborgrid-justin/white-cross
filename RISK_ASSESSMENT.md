## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Scoring Methodology

```
Risk Score = Probability × Impact × Detection Difficulty

Probability Scale:
1 = Rare (< 5% chance)
2 = Unlikely (5-25% chance)
3 = Possible (25-50% chance)
4 = Likely (50-75% chance)
5 = Almost Certain (> 75% chance)

Impact Scale:
1 = Negligible (Minor inconvenience)
2 = Minor (Limited functionality impact)
3 = Moderate (Significant feature impact)
4 = Major (Service disruption, limited data exposure)
5 = Catastrophic (Complete outage, PHI breach, patient safety risk)

Detection Difficulty:
1 = Very Easy (Automatic detection)
2 = Easy (Detected within minutes)
3 = Moderate (Detected within hours)
4 = Difficult (Detected within days)
5 = Very Difficult (May go undetected)

Risk Level Classification:
Critical: Score ≥ 60
High: Score 40-59
Medium: Score 20-39
Low: Score < 20
```

### Risk Treatment Strategies

| Strategy | Description | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Avoid | Eliminate the risk by not performing the activity | Unacceptable risks |
| Mitigate | Reduce probability or impact | Most common strategy |
| Transfer | Share or transfer risk to third party | Insurance, contracts |
| Accept | Acknowledge and monitor the risk | Low-impact risks |

  regions:
    primary: us-east-1
    secondary: us-west-2
  availability_zones: 3+ per region

  compute:
    auto_scaling: true
    min_instances: 6
    max_instances: 50
    health_checks: every 30 seconds

  database:
    type: PostgreSQL RDS

  traffic_routing: gradual (10% → 50% → 100%)
  rollback_trigger: error_rate > 2%
  deployment_window: off-hours only
  approval_required: true
  automated_testing: required

maintenance_windows:

    - State testing periods
    - Federal holidays
```

**Monitoring & Alerting:**
```javascript
// Uptime Monitoring Configuration
const uptimeChecks = {
    critical_endpoints: [
        {
            name: 'API Health',
            url: 'https://api.whitecross.health/health',
            interval: '30s',
            timeout: '5s',
            alert_threshold: 2 // Alert after 2 failures
        },
        {
            name: 'Emergency Contacts',
            url: 'https://api.whitecross.health/v1/emergency-contacts/health',
            interval: '30s',

            alert_threshold: 1 // Immediate alert
        },
        {
            name: 'Medications',
            url: 'https://api.whitecross.health/v1/medications/health',
            interval: '30s',
            timeout: '5s',
            alert_threshold: 1 // Immediate alert
        }
    ],

    response_time_alerts: {
        warning: '200ms',
        critical: '500ms'
    },

    availability_sla: {
        target: '99.99%',
        measurement_period: 'monthly'
    }
};
```

**Business Continuity Plan:**
```markdown
## Emergency Offline Procedures

### When System is Unavailable:
1. **Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)**
   - Activate printed emergency contact lists
   - Reference printed medication schedules
   - Use offline health record binders (PHI secure storage)

2. **Communication (5-15 minutes)**
   - Email notification to all nurses
   - Text message to administrators
   - Status page update
   - Parent communication if extended

3. **Offline Operations (15 minutes - resolution)**
   - Paper-based medication logs
   - Manual incident reports
   - Temporary health record access via encrypted USB drives
   - Emergency contact via phone tree

4. **Recovery (post-incident)**
   - Digitize all paper records within 24 hours
   - Audit log reconciliation
   - Verify no data loss
   - Post-incident review within 48 hours
```

#### Residual Risk
After implementing all controls: **Low-Medium (24)** - 2 × 3 × 4

#### Potential Causes
1. Failed migration scripts
2. Hardware failure
3. Software bugs
4. Accidental deletion
5. Malicious insider
6. Ransomware
7. Backup failure
8. Replication lag

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Data Protection:**
```yaml
backup_strategy:
  automated_backups:
    frequency: every 4 hours
    retention: 30 days
    encryption: AES-256
    testing: weekly restore tests

    replication_lag: < 1 second

  backup_validation:
    automated_restore_test: daily
    data_integrity_check: daily
    backup_monitoring: continuous
```

**Data Integrity Checks:**
```sql
-- Data Integrity Monitoring
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION verify_data_integrity()
RETURNS TABLE(check_name text, status text, details text) AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Check for orphaned records
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT
        'Orphaned Health Records'::text,
        CASE WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 'PASS' ELSE 'FAIL' END::text,
        'Found ' || COUNT(*)::text || ' orphaned records'::text
    FROM health_records hr
    LEFT JOIN students s ON hr.student_id = s.id
    WHERE s.id IS NULL;

    -- Verify foreign key constraints
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT
        'Foreign Key Integrity'::text,
        CASE WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 'PASS' ELSE 'FAIL' END::text,
        COUNT(*)::text || ' constraint violations'::text
    FROM pg_constraint
    WHERE contype = 'f'
    AND NOT convalidated;

    -- Check for duplicate records
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT
        'Duplicate Students'::text,
        CASE WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 'PASS' ELSE 'FAIL' END::text,
        'Found ' || COUNT(*)::text || ' duplicates'::text
    FROM (
        SELECT student_id, COUNT(*)
        FROM students
        GROUP BY student_id
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    ) duplicates;

    -- Verify encryption
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT
        'Encryption Status'::text,
        CASE WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 'PASS' ELSE 'FAIL' END::text,
        COUNT(*)::text || ' unencrypted PHI records'::text
    FROM health_records
    WHERE encrypted_data IS NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Schedule integrity checks
SELECT cron.schedule('data_integrity_check', '0 */6 * * *',
    $$SELECT * FROM verify_data_integrity() WHERE status = 'FAIL'$$
);
```

**Migration Safety:**
```javascript
// Database Migration Safety Wrapper
class SafeMigration {
    async executeMigration(migrationScript) {
        // 1. Create pre-migration backup
        await this.createBackup('pre-migration');

        // 2. Begin transaction
        const transaction = await sequelize.transaction();

        try {
            // 3. Execute migration
            await migrationScript(transaction);

            // 4. Verify data integrity
            const integrityCheck = await this.verifyIntegrity(transaction);
            if (!integrityCheck.passed) {
                throw new Error('Data integrity check failed: ' + integrityCheck.errors);
            }

            // 5. Verify row counts
            const rowCountCheck = await this.verifyRowCounts(transaction);
            if (!rowCountCheck.passed) {
                throw new Error('Row count mismatch: ' + rowCountCheck.details);
            }

            // 6. Commit transaction
            await transaction.commit();

            // 7. Create post-migration backup
            await this.createBackup('post-migration');

            return { success: true };

        } catch (error) {
            // Rollback on any error
            await transaction.rollback();

            // Restore from backup if needed
            await this.restoreBackup('pre-migration');

            logger.error('Migration failed', { error, migration: migrationScript.name });
            throw error;
        }
    }
}

        const isOwner = await this.checkOwnership(user, resource);
        if (!isOwner && !user.role.includes('admin')) {
            this.logAccessDenied(user, resource, action, 'ownership');
            return false;
        }

        // Layer 3: School/district boundary check
        const sameSchool = await this.checkSchoolBoundary(user, resource);

            this.logAccessDenied(user, resource, action, 'boundary');
            return false;
        }

        // Layer 4: PHI-specific checks
        if (resource.type === 'health_record') {
            const phiAllowed = await this.checkPHIAccess(user, resource);
            if (!phiAllowed) {
                this.logAccessDenied(user, resource, action, 'phi');
                return false;

                logger.info(`Circuit breaker HALF_OPEN for ${this.service}`);
            }, this.resetTimeout);
        }
    }
}

// Fallback Implementations
const emailCircuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker('email', {
    failureThreshold: 3,
    resetTimeout: 30000
});

async function sendEmail(to, subject, body) {
    return emailCircuitBreaker.execute(
        async () => {
