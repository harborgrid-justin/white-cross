## Key Achievements

### 1. New Database Model
Created `ChronicCondition` model with comprehensive fields:
- Basic info: condition, diagnosedDate, status, severity
- Care management: notes, carePlan, diagnosedBy
- Treatment: medications array
- Safety: restrictions array, triggers array
- Review tracking: lastReviewDate, nextReviewDate
- Audit: createdAt, updatedAt

### 2. Backend Service Layer
Extended `HealthRecordService` with 8 new methods:
- `addChronicCondition()` - Add new chronic condition
- `getStudentChronicConditions()` - Retrieve with status sorting
- `updateChronicCondition()` - Update condition details
- `deleteChronicCondition()` - Remove condition
- `exportHealthHistory()` - Complete data export
- `importHealthRecords()` - Bulk data import with validation

### 3. RESTful API Endpoints
Added 8 new authenticated endpoints:
- Chronic Conditions CRUD (4 endpoints)
- Import/Export functionality (2 endpoints)
- All with proper validation and error handling

### 4. Frontend UI
Complete redesign of Health Records page:
- 7 tabbed sections for organized access
- Stats dashboard with key metrics
- Search and filter capabilities
- Color-coded status indicators
- Import/Export UI controls
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation
- `HEALTH_RECORDS_DOCUMENTATION.md` - 12KB technical documentation
- API endpoint documentation
- Usage examples with code
- Security and compliance notes
- Database schema details
- Future enhancement suggestions

## API Examples

### Create Health Record
```typescript
POST /api/health-records
{
  "studentId": "student-id",
  "type": "PHYSICAL_EXAM",
  "date": "2024-10-24T10:00:00Z",
  "description": "Annual physical examination",
  "vital": {
    "height": 150,
    "weight": 45,
    "temperature": 36.5,
    "bloodPressureSystolic": 120,
    "bloodPressureDiastolic": 80,
    "heartRate": 72
  },
  "provider": "Dr. Sarah Johnson"
}
```

### Add Chronic Condition
```typescript
POST /api/health-records/chronic-conditions
{
  "studentId": "student-id",
  "condition": "Asthma",
  "diagnosedDate": "2020-05-15",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "severity": "MODERATE",
  "carePlan": "Use inhaler as needed",
  "medications": ["Albuterol inhaler"],
  "triggers": ["Cold air", "Exercise"],
  "restrictions": ["No outdoor activities in cold weather"],
  "nextReviewDate": "2024-12-01"
}
```

### Export Health History
```typescript
GET /api/health-records/export/:studentId

Response:
{
  "exportDate": "2024-10-24T12:00:00Z",
  "student": { /* student details */ },
  "healthRecords": [ /* all health records */ ],
  "allergies": [ /* all allergies */ ],
  "chronicConditions": [ /* all chronic conditions */ ],
  "vaccinations": [ /* all vaccinations */ ],
  "growthData": [ /* growth measurements */ ]
}
```

## Future Enhancements
