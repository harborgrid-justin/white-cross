# Compliance Module - HIPAA-Compliant Healthcare Operations

## Overview

The Compliance Module provides comprehensive HIPAA-compliant features for healthcare operations, including audit logging, consent management, PHI disclosure tracking, and regulatory compliance reporting.

## Regulatory Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance Features

1. **Audit Controls (45 CFR 164.312(b))**
   - Complete audit trails of electronic PHI access and modifications
   - User action tracking with IP address and timestamp
   - Entity-level audit history
   - Tamper-evident logging for security rule compliance

2. **Authorization Requirements (45 CFR 164.508)**
   - Digital consent forms with legal validity
   - Signatory validation and relationship tracking
   - Digital signature capture with IP address logging
   - Consent withdrawal with full audit trail

3. **Accounting of Disclosures (Â§164.528)**
   - PHI disclosure tracking with minimum necessary justification
   - Recipient information and authorization status
   - Follow-up tracking and completion management
   - Compliance reporting and statistics

  action: AuditAction.VIEW,
  entityType: 'HealthRecord',
  entityId: 'record-456',
  ipAddress: '192.168.1.100',
  userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0...'
});
```

### Signing a Consent Form
```typescript
const signature = await consentService.signConsentForm({
  consentFormId: 'form-123',
  studentId: 'student-456',
  signedBy: 'Jane Doe',
  relationship: 'Mother',
  signatureData: 'base64-encoded-signature',
  ipAddress: '192.168.1.100'
});
```

### Retrieving Audit Statistics
```typescript
const stats = await auditService.getAuditStatistics(
  new Date('2025-01-01'),
  new Date('2025-01-31')
);

console.log(`Total audit events: ${stats.totalLogs}`);
console.log('Action distribution:', stats.actionBreakdown);
console.log('Entity access:', stats.entityTypeBreakdown);
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
Use tools like Postman or REST Client to test endpoints:

```http
### Get Audit Logs
GET http://localhost:3000/compliance/audit-logs?page=1&limit=10

### Create Audit Log
POST http://localhost:3000/compliance/audit-logs
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "user-123",
  "action": "VIEW",
  "entityType": "HealthRecord",
  "entityId": "record-456",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100"
}

### Sign Consent Form
POST http://localhost:3000/compliance/consents/sign
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "consentFormId": "form-123",
  "studentId": "student-456",
  "signedBy": "Jane Doe",
  "relationship": "Mother",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100"
}
```

### Automated Testing
(To be implemented)
- Unit tests with Jest
- Integration tests with Supertest
- E2E tests with Test Containers

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints should require authentication
2. **Authorization Rules**: Implement RBAC for compliance operations
3. **Audit All Access**: Every PHI access must generate an audit log
4. **Data Encryption**: PHI must be encrypted at rest and in transit
5. **Secure Signatures**: Digital signatures should use cryptographic validation

## Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Follow existing service patterns (Injectable, Repository pattern)
2. Add comprehensive DTOs with class-validator decorators
3. Include Swagger documentation on all endpoints
4. Maintain HIPAA compliance requirements
5. Add proper error handling and logging
6. Update this README with new features
